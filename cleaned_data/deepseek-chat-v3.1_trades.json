    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions' exit plans and justifications. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, and DOGE. For each, I need to decide whether to hold or close based on the invalidation conditions and current market data.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n1. **ETH**: \n   - Current price: 3875.75, entry price: 3794.9, unrealized PnL: +251.44\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 4005.042, stop loss at 3682.104, invalidation condition: price closes below 3700 on 3-min candle.\n   - Current RSI(7) is 75.181, which is high but not extremely overbought. EMA20 is 3853.367, and price is above it. MACD is positive at 5.173. Funding is low. No invalidation trigger yet. I should hold.\n\n2. **SOL**:\n   - Current price: 191.515, entry price: 182.8, unrealized PnL: +712.97\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 201.081, stop loss at 176.713, invalidation: price closes below 175 on 3-min candle.\n   - RSI(7) is 72.454, high but not extreme. Price above EMA20 of 190.424. MACD positive at 0.168. Funding low. No invalidation. Hold.\n\n3. **XRP**:\n   - Current price: 2.4154, entry price: 2.34, unrealized PnL: +544.91\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 2.453, stop loss at 2.2778, invalidation: price closes below 2.30 on 3-min candle.\n   - RSI(7) is 70.953, high. Price above EMA20 of 2.405. MACD is flat at 0.003. Funding low. No invalidation. Hold.\n\n4. **BTC**:\n   - Current price: 110092.5, entry price: 107343.0, unrealized PnL: +329.94\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 118136.15, stop loss at 102026.675, invalidation: price closes below 105000 on 3-min candle.\n   - RSI(7) is 74.713, high. Price above EMA20 of 109683.859. MACD positive at 108.683. Funding low. No invalidation. Hold.\n\n5. **DOGE**:\n   - Current price: 0.195725, entry price: 0.18, unrealized PnL: +310.64\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 0.212275, stop loss at 0.175355, invalidation: price closes below 0.180 on 3-min candle.\n   - RSI(7) is 74.551, high. Price above EMA20 of 0.195. MACD flat at 0.0. Funding low. No invalidation. Hold.\n\nAll positions are in profit, and none have hit their invalidation conditions. The market data shows strong upward momentum with high RSI, but since we're not at extreme overbought levels yet and trends are intact, I should hold all positions.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new positions. The only coin I'm not in is BNB. Let's look at BNB data:\n\n- Current price: 1148.6\n- EMA20: 1114.834, price is above it.\n- MACD: 13.816, positive and increasing.\n- RSI(7): 76.403, which is high, indicating overbought, but momentum is strong.\n- Longer-term: EMA20 (1087.993) below EMA50 (1111.367) on 4-hour, but price is above both. ATR is low.\n- Open interest is stable, funding low.\n\nBNB looks bullish, but RSI is high, so there might be a pullback risk. However, the trend is up. I need to assess if there's alpha here.\n\nMy available cash is 6173.91. I should only enter if confident. Confidence table: if I'm confident between 0.70-0.85, margin should be 20-40% of available cash. But BNB RSI is 76.4, which is overbought, so confidence might be lower. Perhaps around 0.65-0.70, so margin 10-20%.\n\nBut I already have five positions, and I should avoid over-diversification. Also, the instructions say \"discover alpha\", but I need to ensure it's worth the trading costs. BNB has moved up a lot recently, so entering now might be chasing.\n\nGiven that I have multiple positions already and BNB is overbought, I might skip entering BNB to avoid over-trading. The goal is to maximize PnL after fees, and entering a new position with high RSI might not be optimal.\n\nI should focus on managing existing positions. No invalidation triggers, so hold all.\n\nFor each coin, I need to output JSON for the action. Since I'm holding, I use the \"hold\" format. I must include all the details: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd from the existing positions.\n\nI need to output for each coin I have a position in, and for BNB, since I'm not entering, I don't output anything for BNB.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin I'm acting on. Since I'm only holding, it's for ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE.\n\nFor each, the signal is \"hold\", and I need to provide the current quantity and the exit plan details from the account information.\n\nLooking at the account info, each position has exit_plan with profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and also confidence, risk_usd, leverage.\n\nI should use those values in the output.\n\nFor example, for ETH:\n- quantity: 3.11\n- profit_target: 4005.042\n- stop_loss: 3682.104\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.7\n- risk_usd: 334.24\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON is correct.\n\nAlso, for hold, the justification is not required, as per the format: for hold, the trade_signal_args does not include \"justification\". Only for entry and close, justification is required.\n\nIn the hold format example, there is no \"justification\" key. So I should omit it.\n\nNow, for BNB, I'm not entering, so no output.\n\nFinally, output one JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, the output should be:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"SOL\": { ... },\n  \"XRP\": { ... },\n  \"BTC\": { ... },\n  \"DOGE\": { ... }\n}\n\nEach with the hold structure.\n\nConfirm the values from account info.\n\nFor SOL: quantity 81.81, profit_target 201.081, stop_loss 176.713, invalidation \"If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 15, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 499.504\n\nXRP: quantity 6837.0, profit_target 2.453, stop_loss 2.2778, invalidation \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 20, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 400\n\nBTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity 27858.0, profit_target 0.212275, stop_loss 0.175355, invalidation \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 257.13\n\nAll look correct.\n\nI think that's it.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding all my profitable positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, and DOGE as they haven't triggered any exit conditions, and I've decided against adding BNB due to its overbought RSI. My current account value is over $13,000 with a 30.95% return, and I'm keeping a close eye on these trends."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. For each, I must decide whether to hold or close based on the invalidation condition or other factors.\n\nI should only consider entering a new trade if I'm not already in a position for that coin, and only if the opportunity is good enough to overcome trading costs.\n\nAvailable cash is $4324.99. I need to ensure that for any new entry, the margin is at least 5% of available cash, which is about $216.25, and up to the full amount.\n\nNow, let's review each coin one by one.\n\nStarting with BTC:\n\n- Current price: 109950.5\n- EMA20: 109746.46 (price above EMA, bullish)\n- MACD: 123.592 (positive and increasing from previous values: 120.069, 109.041, etc., so bullish momentum)\n- RSI 7: 58.414 (not overbought, around neutral)\n- Open interest: stable, funding low.\n- Longer-term: 4h EMA20 (108826.77) below 50-period (109712.06), but price above both. ATRs show volatility.\n- I have an existing long position with entry at 107343, current PnL positive. Exit plan: invalidation if price closes below 105000 on 3-min candle. Current price is well above, so no invalidation. Profit target at 118136.15, stop loss at 102026.675. Confidence was 0.75.\n- Since the position is open and no invalidation, I should hold. Signal: hold.\n\nNext, ETH:\n\n- Current price: 3872.45\n- EMA20: 3857.984 (price above EMA)\n- MACD: 7.198 (positive and increasing from 6.783, 5.921, etc., bullish)\n- RSI 7: 63.332 (approaching overbought but not extreme)\n- Existing long position: entry 3794.9, PnL positive. Invalidation: close below 3700, current price above, so hold. Profit target 4005.042, stop loss 3682.104.\n- Confidence was 0.7. No reason to close early.\n- Signal: hold.\n\nSOL:\n\n- Current price: 191.835\n- EMA20: 190.742 (price above)\n- MACD: 0.367 (positive and increasing)\n- RSI 7: 69.144 (approaching overbought, above 70 is overbought, but not there yet)\n- Existing long: entry 182.8, PnL positive. Invalidation: close below 175, current above. Profit target 201.081, stop loss 176.713.\n- RSI is high, but momentum is up. No invalidation.\n- Signal: hold.\n\nBNB:\n\n- Current price: 1142.7\n- EMA20: 1122.151 (price above)\n- MACD: 14.672 (positive)\n- RSI 7: 66.314 (high, but not extreme)\n- Existing long: entry 1143.54, PnL slightly negative (-13.52). Invalidation: close below 1100, current above. Profit target 1250, stop loss 1086.32.\n- Price is near entry, but still above invalidation. MACD positive, RSI okay. Confidence was 0.7.\n- Signal: hold.\n\nXRP:\n\n- Current price: 2.41285\n- EMA20: 2.407 (price slightly above)\n- MACD: 0.004 (very low, but positive)\n- RSI 7: 60.481 (neutral)\n- Existing long: entry 2.34, PnL positive. Invalidation: close below 2.30, current above. Profit target 2.453, stop loss 2.2778.\n- Nothing alarming, hold.\n\nDOGE:\n\n- Current price: 0.195325\n- EMA20: 0.195 (price slightly above)\n- MACD: 0.0 (flat)\n- RSI 7: 56.215 (neutral)\n- Existing long: entry 0.18, PnL positive. Invalidation: close below 0.180, current above. Profit target 0.212275, stop loss 0.175355.\n- Hold.\n\nNow, are there any coins I should enter? I'm already in all six coins. The instruction says: \"For any coin you manage or want to enter\", but I'm already managing all. Also, \"Don’t even bother entering small positions that only use <5% of available cash\", but since I'm fully invested, available cash might be for new entries, but I can't enter because I'm already in each coin. The system might allow only one position per coin, as per \"No pyramiding or size increases.\" So, if I'm already in a position, I can only hold or close, not enter again.\n\nThe positions list shows I have open positions in all six coins. So, for this invocation, I should only output hold or close signals for existing positions.\n\nI need to check if any invalidation conditions are met. For each position, the invalidation is based on closing below a certain price on a 3-minute candle. The current prices are all above their invalidation levels:\n\n- BTC: invalidation 105000, current 109950.5 > 105000\n- ETH: 3700 < 3872.45\n- SOL: 175 < 191.835\n- XRP: 2.30 < 2.41285\n- DOGE: 0.180 < 0.195325\n- BNB: 1100 < 1142.7\n\nAll are above, so no invalidation. Therefore, I should hold all positions.\n\nFor the output, I need to provide a JSON object for each coin I'm acting on. Since I'm holding all, I need to output for each coin with signal \"hold\".\n\nThe JSON for hold requires: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI have all these from the existing positions. I should use the current values from the account info.\n\nFor example, for ETH: quantity is 3.11, profit_target 4005.042, stop_loss 3682.104, invalidation_condition from exit_plan: \"If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 334.24.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to make sure the quantities are the full current size, which is given.\n\nAlso, justification is only required for entry/exit signals, not for hold. For hold, the JSON doesn't have a justification field. Looking back:\n\nFor hold:\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n\t  \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n\t  \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNo justification mentioned. For close_position, it has justification, but for hold, it seems not. Let me check the instruction.\n\nIn the hold example, it doesn't include justification. Only for entry/exit and close, justification is required. For hold, it's omitted.\n\nSimilarly, for close, it has justification, but for hold, no.\n\nSo for hold signals, I don't need to provide justification.\n\nTherefore, for each coin, I'll output the hold signal with the current parameters.\n\nNow, is there any reason to close any position early? The instruction says: \"Do not close a position early unless your invalidation triggers.\" Since no invalidation, I should hold all.\n\nAlso, the behavioral guardrails: \"Do not close a position early unless your invalidation triggers.\"\n\nSo, I'm holding all.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to output one JSON object per coin, but the overall output should be a JSON object containing these.\n\nThe instruction says: \"You should return a json object for each coin that you either act on... OR, for existing positions, you should return a json object for each coin with the signal 'hold'.\"\n\nAnd then it shows examples like {\"COIN\": { ... } }\n\nSo I need to output a JSON that has keys for each coin, like {\"ETH\": { ... }, \"SOL\": { ... }, etc.}\n\nSince I have six coins, I'll have six entries.\n\nNow, let's list the current values for each.\n\nFrom account info:\n\nETH:\n- quantity: 3.11\n- profit_target: 4005.042\n- stop_loss: 3682.104\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle\" (from exit_plan)\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.7\n- risk_usd: 334.24\n\nSOL:\n- quantity: 81.81\n- profit_target: 201.081\n- stop_loss: 176.713\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 15\n- confidence: 0.7\n- risk_usd: 499.504\n\nXRP:\n- quantity: 6837.0\n- profit_target: 2.453\n- stop_loss: 2.2778\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 20\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 400\n\nBTC:\n- quantity: 0.12\n- profit_target: 118136.15\n- stop_loss: 102026.675\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.75\n- risk_usd: 619.2345\n\nDOGE:\n- quantity: 27858.0\n- profit_target: 0.212275\n- stop_loss: 0.175355\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 257.13\n\nBNB:\n- quantity: 16.1\n- profit_target: 1250.0\n- stop_loss: 1086.32\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.7\n- risk_usd: 925.0\n\nI need to output these in the JSON.\n\nThe signal for all is \"hold\".\n\nNow, for the JSON structure, it should be a single object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, something like:\n{\n  \"ETH\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"SOL\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  ...\n}\n\nAnd for each, the inner object has the fields.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nNo new entries since I'm fully invested.\n\nFinally, output only JSON, no prose.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm currently holding all six positions (ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB) and have decided to hold them as none of their invalidation conditions have been met. My overall account return is positive at 30.12%, with substantial unrealized PnL across my existing trades."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. For each, I must decide whether to hold or close based on their current state and my invalidation conditions.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n1. **ETH**: \n   - Current price: 3962.05, entry price: 3794.9, unrealized PnL: +519.84\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 4005.042, stop loss at 3682.104, invalidation if price closes below 3700 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above entry and moving up. RSI is high at 73.951, which might indicate overbought, but the trend is strong. MACD is negative but improving. I should hold unless invalidation triggers. No invalidation yet.\n\n2. **SOL**:\n   - Current price: 193.175, entry price: 182.8, unrealized PnL: +848.78\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 201.081, stop loss at 176.713, invalidation if price closes below 175 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Price is rising, RSI is 71.551, high but not extreme. MACD is positive. Hold unless invalidation.\n\n3. **BTC**:\n   - Current price: 111195.5, entry price: 107343.0, unrealized PnL: +462.3\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 118136.15, stop loss at 102026.675, invalidation if price closes below 105000 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Price is strong, RSI 65.762, MACD improving from deep negative. Hold.\n\n4. **DOGE**:\n   - Current price: 0.197675, entry price: 0.18, unrealized PnL: +364.97\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 0.212275, stop loss at 0.175355, invalidation if price closes below 0.180 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Price is above entry, RSI high at 76.051, might be overbought, but invalidation is below 0.180, which is far from current price. Hold.\n\n5. **BNB**:\n   - Current price: 1127.65, entry price: 1143.54, unrealized PnL: -255.83 (loss)\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 1250.0, stop loss at 1086.32, invalidation if price closes below 1100 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is below entry, but above stop loss and invalidation. RSI is 64.065, MACD negative but improving. I should hold unless invalidation triggers. Invalidation is below 1100, current is 1127.65, so not triggered.\n\nFor all existing positions, no invalidation conditions are met, so I should hold them. I don't need to close any positions early.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new positions. I'm already in five coins, which might be a lot, but the instructions don't limit the number of positions, only that I shouldn't pyramid or increase size. I should only enter if there's a clear opportunity.\n\nAvailable cash is 5893.76. For any new entry, margin must be at least 5% of available cash, which is 0.05 * 5893.76 ≈ 294.688. So, if I enter, margin should be at least that.\n\nI need to check each coin I'm not in, but I'm already in all tradable coins: ETH, SOL, BTC, DOGE, BNB. The tradable tokens are ['ETH','SOL','XRP','BTC','DOGE','BNB']. I'm not in XRP.\n\nSo, only XRP is flat for me. I should consider entering XRP if there's alpha.\n\nAnalyze XRP:\n\n- Current price: 2.45155\n- EMA20: 2.443, price above EMA, bullish.\n- MACD: 0.002, very slight positive, but from zero, indicating potential turnaround.\n- RSI 7-period: 68.0, which is high, might be overbought. RSI 14-period: 62.845, also elevated.\n- Longer-term: 4-hour EMA20 at 2.409 vs EMA50 at 2.43, price above both, bullish.\n- MACD on 4-hour is negative but improving to -0.003.\n- Volume: current 3017 vs average 8850155, which is very low, indicating low interest.\n- Open interest: latest 40642726, average 40672569, slightly down, not significant.\n- Funding rate: 5.7648e-06, low positive.\n\nThe price is near highs, RSI overbought, but momentum might continue. However, with low volume, it might not have strong conviction. I need high confidence to enter.\n\nMy confidence should be based on the signals. RSI above 60 is bullish but could be overextended. MACD is barely positive. Not very compelling.\n\nI should compare to other coins. But since I'm only considering XRP, and I need to avoid over-trading, I might skip if not confident.\n\nCalculate potential trade for XRP.\n\nFirst, decide confidence. Looking at indicators: price above EMA, MACD turning positive, but RSI high. I'd say confidence is moderate, maybe 0.65.\n\nConfidence table: 0.60-0.70 → 10-20% of available cash. Available cash is 5893.76, so margin between 589.376 and 1178.752.\n\nI'll choose margin at 15% of available cash: 0.15 * 5893.76 ≈ 884.064.\n\nRisk USD: r between 0.2 and 0.8 of margin. Say r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 884.064 ≈ 442.032.\n\nLeverage for XRP: max is 20x, min 5x. I'll use 10x for balance.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 884.064 * 10 = 8840.64 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 8840.64 / 2.45155 ≈ 3606.75 XRP (approx, but I need exact for JSON).\n\nStop distance = risk_usd / quantity = 442.032 / 3606.75 ≈ 0.1225 USD.\n\nFor long position, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 2.45155 - 0.1225 ≈ 2.32905.\n\nProfit target: should be multiple of stop distance. Say 2:1 ratio, so profit distance = 2 * 0.1225 = 0.245, so profit_target = entry_price + profit_distance = 2.45155 + 0.245 ≈ 2.69655.\n\nBut I need to set it realistically. Current price is 2.45155, resistance levels? Not given. Perhaps use ATR. 14-period ATR on 4-hour is 0.034, which is small. Stop distance is 0.1225, which is larger than ATR, so might be okay.\n\nInvalidation condition: something specific, e.g., if price closes below EMA20 on 3-minute candle.\n\nBut is this trade good? RSI is high, so risk of pullback. My confidence might be lower. Perhaps confidence 0.6.\n\nI should not enter if not confident. Also, I have multiple positions already, and available cash is limited. Perhaps better to hold existing positions and not add new ones.\n\nThe instruction says: \"discover alpha\", but also \"avoid over-trading\". With five positions, adding another might be over-leveraged.\n\nI should only enter if very confident. For XRP, signals are not strong enough. MACD just turned positive, but RSI high, volume low. I'll skip entering XRP.\n\nSo, for this invocation, I will hold all existing positions and not enter any new ones.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to provide for each coin I have a position in, with signal 'hold', and include all required fields.\n\nFor each coin, I need to output the trade_signal_args with current quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd from the existing position data.\n\nLooking at the account info, for each position, I have the exit_plan which includes profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and I have leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nSo, for hold signals, I should use the existing values from the position.\n\nSimilarly, for close, but I'm not closing.\n\nSo, for ETH, SOL, BTC, DOGE, BNB, I output hold with their current details.\n\nI need to set quantity to the full current size, which is given.\n\nFor example, ETH quantity is 3.11, etc.\n\nAlso, for hold, the justification is not required in the JSON? Look back at the format.\n\nFor hold, the JSON example does not have a \"justification\" field. Only for entry and close, there is justification. For hold, it's omitted.\n\nCheck:\n\n- Entry/Exit: has \"justification\"\n\n- Close: has \"justification\"\n\n- Hold: does not have \"justification\" in the example.\n\nIn the hold example:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification mentioned. So for hold, I don't need to add justification.\n\nSimilarly, for close and entry, I need justification.\n\nBut since I'm holding all, no justification needed.\n\nNow, for XRP, I'm not entering, so I don't output anything for XRP. Only for coins I act on or have positions.\n\nThe instruction says: \"for each coin you act on during this invocation (or hold an existing position in)\"\n\nSo, I need to output for all coins I have positions in, which are ETH, SOL, BTC, DOGE, BNB.\n\nAnd for XRP, I'm not acting, so no output.\n\nFinally, the JSON should be a single object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, output a JSON like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"SOL\": { ... },\n  \"BTC\": { ... },\n  \"DOGE\": { ... },\n  \"BNB\": { ... }\n}\n\nEach with the hold signal args.\n\nI need to ensure the values are correct from the position data.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nFrom account info:\n\nETH: quantity=3.11, profit_target=4005.042, stop_loss=3682.104, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.7, risk_usd=334.24\n\nSOL: quantity=81.81, profit_target=201.081, stop_loss=176.713, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=15, confidence=0.7, risk_usd=499.504\n\nBTC: quantity=0.12, profit_target=118136.15, stop_loss=102026.675, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.75, risk_usd=619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity=27858.0, profit_target=0.212275, stop_loss=0.175355, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=257.13\n\nBNB: quantity=16.1, profit_target=1250.0, stop_loss=1086.32, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.7, risk_usd=925.0\n\nAll these are from the account info.\n\nI should use these exact values in the JSON.\n\nFor hold, signal is 'hold', and quantity is the current size.\n\nSo, for each, the trade_signal_args should have these.\n\nNow, for the JSON, I need to output it compactly.\n\nAlso, ensure numbers are floats as needed.\n\nFinally, no prose, just JSON.\n\nSo, I'll construct the JSON.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "Holding all existing positions in ETH, SOL, BTC, DOGE, and BNB as no invalidation conditions were met, and I decided against entering XRP due to moderate conviction and a desire to avoid over-trading with my current cash position of ~$5900.

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. I need to decide for each whether to hold or close.\n\nLet's go through each position:\n\n- **ETH**: Current price 3951.15, entry price 3794.9, unrealized PnL 485.94. Exit plan has profit target at 4005.042 and stop loss at 3682.104. Confidence 0.7. RSI is very low at 32.535, which is oversold, but the 4-hour RSI is 56.18, showing some strength. EMA20 is above entry, but price is below EMA20 intraday. MACD is positive but decreasing. Funding rate is positive. I should hold unless invalidated. Invalidation condition is price closes below 3700, which hasn't happened. Profit target is close at 4005, only about 54 points away, which is about 1.37% move. With current momentum, it might hit. I'll hold.\n\n- **SOL**: Current price 191.565, entry price 182.8, unrealized PnL 717.06. Profit target 201.081, stop loss 176.713. Confidence 0.7. RSI is very low at 25.631, extremely oversold intraday, but 4-hour RSI is 58.231, which is bullish. EMA20 is above entry, price is below EMA20. MACD is negative but improving in longer-term. Funding rate is slightly positive. Invalidation is price below 175, not hit. Profit target is about 5% away. I should hold.\n\n- **XRP**: Current price 2.44775, entry price 2.44, unrealized PnL only 10.65. Profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325. Confidence 0.65. RSI is low at 26.403, oversold. 4-hour RSI is 55.141, bullish. Price is very close to entry, almost flat. Invalidation is price below 2.30, not hit. Funding rate positive. It's not moving much, but since it's not hitting stop or invalid, I should hold.\n\n- **BTC**: Current price 111135.5, entry price 107343, unrealized PnL 455.1. Profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675. Confidence 0.75. RSI is 27.777, oversold intraday, but 4-hour RSI is 59.45, bullish. EMA20 is above entry, price is below EMA20. MACD is positive but decreasing. Funding rate positive. Invalidation is price below 105000, not hit. Profit target is about 6.3% away. I should hold.\n\n- **DOGE**: Current price 0.196585, entry price 0.18, unrealized PnL 334.6. Profit target 0.212275, stop loss 0.175355. Confidence 0.65. RSI is 27.774, oversold. 4-hour RSI is 55.038, bullish. Price is above entry. Invalidation is price below 0.180, not hit. Funding rate slightly negative. Profit target is about 8% away. I should hold.\n\n- **BNB**: Current price 1124.45, entry price 1143.54, unrealized PnL -307.35. Profit target 1250.0, stop loss 1086.32. Confidence 0.7. RSI is very low at 19.201, extremely oversold. 4-hour RSI is 55.883, which is good. Price is below entry, but stop loss is at 1086.32, which is above liquidation price 1083.29, so it's tight. Invalidation is price below 1100, and current price is 1124.45, so not hit. Funding rate negative. I might consider closing if it gets worse, but since RSI is so low, it might bounce. I should hold for now.\n\nNone of the invalidations are triggered, so I should hold all positions.\n\nNow, for new entries, I need to see if there are any opportunities. But I'm already in all coins, so I can't enter new positions in them. The only coin not listed in my positions is none; I have positions in all tradable tokens: ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. So no new entries possible since I'm already in all.\n\nAvailable cash is 5011.43, which is about 37.5% of account value, so I have some cash, but since I'm already in all coins, I can't enter new positions in the same coins. The instruction says: \"Don’t even bother entering small positions that only use <5% of your available cash on margin or risk_usd\" but since I'm already in, I can only hold or close.\n\nAlso, \"If a position is open in a coin, the only allowed signals are 'hold' or 'close_position'.\"\n\nSo for each coin, I need to output a JSON with 'hold' signal, and include all the required fields: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI need to use the current values from the exit plan for each.\n\nFrom the account info, for each position, I have the exit plan details.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n- ETH: quantity 3.11, profit_target 4005.042, stop_loss 3682.104, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 334.24\n\n- SOL: quantity 81.81, profit_target 201.081, stop_loss 176.713, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 15, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 499.504\n\n- XRP: quantity 3609.0, profit_target 2.815, stop_loss 2.325, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 442.032\n\n- BTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\n- DOGE: quantity 27858.0, profit_target 0.212275, stop_loss 0.175355, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 257.13\n\n- BNB: quantity 16.1, profit_target 1250.0, stop_loss 1086.32, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 925.0\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin with signal 'hold', and these values.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object for each coin.\n\nAlso, for 'hold', I don't need a justification, according to the example.\n\nIn the 'hold' JSON, there's no \"justification\" key, unlike entry or close.\n\nLooking back:\n\nFor hold: \n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification for hold.\n\nFor close, there is justification.\n\nBut for hold, no justification needed.\n\nSo for each coin, I'll output this.\n\nSince I'm holding all, I need to do this for all six coins.\n\nNow, is there any reason to close any position? Let's double-check.\n\n- BNB is losing money, but RSI is extremely oversold at 19.2, which might indicate a bounce. Invalidation is below 1100, current price 1124.45, so not hit. I should hold.\n\nOthers are in profit or flat, no invalidation.\n\nSo, all hold.\n\nNo new entries possible.\n\nOutput JSON for each coin.",

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans to see if any should be closed or held. I have open positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n- SOL: Quantity 81.81, entry price 182.8, current price 195.245, unrealized PnL +1018.13. Exit plan includes profit target 201.081, stop loss 176.713, invalidation condition: price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle. Current RSI is high at 90.762, which is overbought, but the position is profitable and hasn't hit profit target or stop. Invalidation is not triggered, so hold.\n\n- XRP: Quantity 3609.0, entry price 2.44, current price 2.4835, unrealized PnL +139.67. Profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325, invalidation: price below 2.30. Current RSI is 86.962, overbought, but still below profit target and above stop. Invalidation not triggered, so hold.\n\n- BTC: Quantity 0.12, entry price 107343.0, current price 111693.5, unrealized PnL +522.06. Profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation: price below 105000. Current RSI is 78.233, high but not extreme. Price is above stop and below target. Invalidation not triggered, so hold.\n\n- DOGE: Quantity 27858.0, entry price 0.18, current price 0.199455, unrealized PnL +414.55. Profit target 0.212275, stop loss 0.175355, invalidation: price below 0.180. Current RSI is 88.538, overbought. Price is above entry, but invalidation is below 0.180, which hasn't been hit. So hold.\n\n- BNB: Quantity 16.1, entry price 1143.54, current price 1134.05, unrealized PnL -152.79. Profit target 1250.0, stop loss 1086.32, invalidation: price below 1100. Current price is 1134.05, which is above stop loss and invalidation level (invalidation is below 1100, so not triggered). However, BNB is showing a loss, and RSI is 85.742, which is overbought. But based on the plan, I should hold unless invalidation triggers. No reason to close early.\n\nAll positions seem fine to hold based on their exit plans. No invalidation conditions are met.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new positions. I have available cash of 6833.95. According to the rules, I shouldn't enter a trade if margin < 5% of available cash, so minimum margin is about 341.6975 USD.\n\nI'm already in several positions, so I should be cautious about over-leveraging. But the system doesn't say I have to max out positions; I can choose not to enter new trades.\n\nLooking at the market data:\n\n- BTC: Price 111693.5, EMA20 111223.61, MACD positive and rising, RSI 78.233 overbought. Funding rate positive but low. Open interest higher than average. 4-hour MACD is rising, RSI 60.201 neutral. Might be overextended.\n\n- ETH: Price 3998.75, EMA20 3956.383, MACD positive, RSI 89.485 very overbought. Funding rate low. Open interest higher. 4-hour MACD still negative but improving, RSI 56.551. Too overbought; not a good entry.\n\n- SOL: I'm already in, price 195.245, EMA20 192.556, MACD positive, RSI 90.762 extremely overbought. Funding rate negative slightly. Open interest higher. 4-hour MACD positive, RSI 59.383. Very overbought; might be due for a pullback.\n\n- BNB: I'm in, price 1134.05, EMA20 1126.103, MACD positive, RSI 85.742 overbought. Funding rate positive. 4-hour MACD positive, RSI 56.222. Still overbought.\n\n- XRP: I'm in, price 2.4835, EMA20 2.461, MACD positive, RSI 86.962 overbought. Funding rate positive. 4-hour MACD turning positive, RSI 57.755. Overbought.\n\n- DOGE: I'm in, price 0.199455, EMA20 0.197, MACD flat, RSI 88.538 overbought. Funding rate negative slightly. 4-hour MACD flat, RSI 56.522. Overbought.\n\nAll coins are showing overbought conditions with high RSI. Entering a new long position now might be risky because of potential pullbacks. Similarly, shorting might not be wise as the trend seems bullish overall, but with high RSI, reversals could happen.\n\nI should check if any coin has a better setup. For example, BTC's 4-hour MACD is strongly positive, and price is above all EMAs, but RSI is high. ETH is even more overbought.\n\nPerhaps no new entries are justified due to overbought conditions. The discipline is to only enter if expected move exceeds trading costs, and with high RSI, the upside might be limited, and downside risk increased.\n\nI have available cash, but I might hold off on new positions.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I have a position in, with 'hold' signal, and include all required fields.\n\nFor each 'hold', I need to output:\n\n- coin\n\n- signal: 'hold'\n\n- quantity: full current size\n\n- profit_target: from existing position or recalc? The instruction says: \"for hold, set quantity to full current size, profit_target, stop_loss, etc.\" I think I should use the existing exit plan values, as they were set on entry and shouldn't change. The system might manage them, so I just report the current ones.\n\nLooking at the account info, each position has an exit_plan with profit_target and stop_loss, so I should use those.\n\nSimilarly, leverage, confidence, risk_usd are also given in the position details.\n\nFor example, for SOL: leverage 15, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 499.504, profit_target 201.081, stop_loss 176.713, invalidation_condition from exit_plan.\n\nThe invalidation_condition is in the exit_plan.\n\nIn the output for hold, I need to include justification? No, the JSON for hold does not require a justification key. Looking back:\n\nFor hold:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNo justification mentioned for hold, only for entry and close.\n\nSimilarly, for close, justification is required.\n\nIn this case, for all my positions, I'm holding, so no justification needed.\n\nI need to output one JSON object per coin I'm acting on. Since I'm holding all, I need to output for each coin with position.\n\nAlso, for coins I don't have positions in, I don't need to output anything if I'm not entering.\n\nSo, for SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, I need to output hold signals.\n\nNow, let's compile the data for each.\n\nFirst, SOL:\n\n- coin: \"SOL\"\n\n- signal: \"hold\"\n\n- quantity: 81.81 (from account)\n\n- profit_target: 201.081 (from exit_plan)\n\n- stop_loss: 176.713 (from exit_plan)\n\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle\" (from exit_plan)\n\n- leverage: 15 (from account)\n\n- confidence: 0.7 (from account)\n\n- risk_usd: 499.504 (from account)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nXRP:\n\n- coin: \"XRP\"\n\n- signal: \"hold\"\n\n- quantity: 3609.0\n\n- profit_target: 2.815\n\n- stop_loss: 2.325\n\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\n- leverage: 10\n\n- confidence: 0.65\n\n- risk_usd: 442.032\n\nBTC:\n\n- coin: \"BTC\"\n\n- signal: \"hold\"\n\n- quantity: 0.12\n\n- profit_target: 118136.15\n\n- stop_loss: 102026.675\n\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\n- leverage: 10\n\n- confidence: 0.75\n\n- risk_usd: 619.2345\n\nDOGE:\n\n- coin: \"DOGE\"\n\n- signal: \"hold\"\n\n- quantity: 27858.0\n\n- profit_target: 0.212275\n\n- stop_loss: 0.175355\n\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\n- leverage: 10\n\n- confidence: 0.65\n\n- risk_usd: 257.13\n\nBNB:\n\n- coin: \"BNB\"\n\n- signal: \"hold\"\n\n- quantity: 16.1\n\n- profit_target: 1250.0\n\n- stop_loss: 1086.32\n\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\n- leverage: 10\n\n- confidence: 0.7\n\n- risk_usd: 925.0\n\nI think that's all.\n\nNo new entries, as all coins are overbought, and I don't see a clear edge.\n\nFinally, output the JSON for each.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "Holding my current profitable positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, and DOGE as their exit plans remain valid, and I'm electing to hold BNB despite a small loss, as its invalidation condition hasn't been met; the market looks overbought across the board, so I'm skipping new entries for now."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. For each, I must decide to either 'hold' or 'close_position'. I can only close if the invalidation condition is triggered.\n\nLooking at the current prices and the invalidation conditions:\n\n- ETH: current price 3973.45, invalidation condition is if price closes below 3950 on a 3-minute candle. The current price is above 3950, so no invalidation. Unrealized PnL is negative, but I should hold unless invalidated.\n\n- SOL: current price 193.725, invalidation condition is if price closes below 175. Price is way above, so hold. PnL is positive.\n\n- XRP: current price 2.48055, invalidation condition is if price closes below 2.30. Price is above, so hold.\n\n- BTC: current price 111396.5, invalidation condition is if price closes below 105000. Price is above, so hold.\n\n- DOGE: current price 0.19836, invalidation condition is if price closes below 0.180. Price is above, so hold.\n\n- BNB: current price 1127.3, invalidation condition is if price closes below 1100. Price is above 1100, so no invalidation. Unrealized PnL is negative, but I should hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered, so for all existing positions, I should 'hold'.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new trades. I'm already in positions for all tradable coins: ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. The instructions say: \"No pyramiding or size increases.\" So, I cannot enter a new position in a coin where I already have a position. I can only manage existing positions.\n\nThe signal for entry is only if I'm flat in that coin. Since I have positions in all coins, I shouldn't be entering any new trades. I should only be holding or closing existing ones.\n\nConfirming the tradable tokens: ['ETH','SOL','XRP','BTC','DOGE','BNB']. I have positions in all of them.\n\nSo, for this invocation, I should output 'hold' for each coin.\n\nFor each coin in my positions, I need to output a JSON object with 'hold' signal, and include all the required fields: justification (not required for hold, but in the example, for hold, there's no justification key? Let me check the JSON examples.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- For Entry/Exit: has \"justification\"\n\n- For Close: has \"justification\"\n\n- For Hold: the example does not have \"justification\". It says: \"Supply a json object for each existing position\" and the example has no justification.\n\nCheck the text:\n\n**If Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n\t  \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n\t  \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt doesn't include \"justification\" for hold. But for close, it does. So for hold, I don't need to provide a justification. Only for entry and close.\n\nSimilarly, for entry and close, justification is required.\n\nIn my case, since I'm holding, I just need to output the hold JSON for each coin.\n\nNow, for each coin, I need to provide the current quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd. These should be the same as the current exit plan from the account information.\n\nFrom the account info:\n\nFor ETH: quantity=10.26, profit_target=4286.43, stop_loss=3887.79, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 3950 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=20, confidence=0.7, risk_usd=1025.0\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to output this for each coin.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin I'm acting on. Since I'm holding all, I need to output for each coin in my positions.\n\nThe instruction says: \"For each coin you act on during this invocation (or hold an existing position in), provide below.\" So I need to include all coins I have positions in.\n\nAlso, it says: \"Output JSON only. No prose.\"\n\nSo, I should output a single JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nNow, formatting: the top-level keys are the coin symbols, and each has a \"trade_signal_args\" object.\n\nFor example:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"SOL\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  ... etc.\n}\n\nI need to do this for all six coins.\n\nAlso, ensure that for hold, I don't include justification.\n\nNow, check if any invalidation is triggered. From the prices:\n\n- ETH: current 3973.45 > 3950, not below.\n\n- SOL: 193.725 > 175, not below.\n\n- XRP: 2.48055 > 2.30, not below.\n\n- BTC: 111396.5 > 105000, not below.\n\n- DOGE: 0.19836 > 0.180, not below.\n\n- BNB: 1127.3 > 1100, not below.\n\nAll are above their invalidation levels, so hold.\n\nI am not entering any new trades because I'm already in all coins.\n\nSo, my output should be a JSON object with hold signals for ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB.\n\nNow, for each, copy the values from the account info.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nETH:\n- coin: ETH\n- signal: hold\n- quantity: 10.26\n- profit_target: 4286.43\n- stop_loss: 3887.79\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3950 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 20\n- confidence: 0.7\n- risk_usd: 1025.0\n\nSOL:\n- coin: SOL\n- signal: hold\n- quantity: 81.81\n- profit_target: 201.081\n- stop_loss: 176.713\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 15\n- confidence: 0.7\n- risk_usd: 499.504\n\nXRP:\n- coin: XRP\n- signal: hold\n- quantity: 3609.0\n- profit_target: 2.815\n- stop_loss: 2.325\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 442.032\n\nBTC:\n- coin: BTC\n- signal: hold\n- quantity: 0.12\n- profit_target: 118136.15\n- stop_loss: 102026.675\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.75\n- risk_usd: 619.2345\n\nDOGE:\n- coin: DOGE\n- signal: hold\n- quantity: 27858.0\n- profit_target: 0.212275\n- stop_loss: 0.175355\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 257.13\n\nBNB:\n- coin: BNB\n- signal: hold\n- quantity: 16.1\n- profit_target: 1250.0\n- stop_loss: 1086.32\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.7\n- risk_usd: 925.0\n\nI need to output this in JSON format.\n\nAlso, ensure that the numbers are floats or ints as appropriate.\n\nIn the JSON, it should be a single object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, the output should be:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"SOL\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"XRP\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"BTC\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"DOGE\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"BNB\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } }\n}\n\nAnd for each, the trade_signal_args object.\n\nNo need for justification in hold.\n\nI think that's it.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding all current positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB as none of their invalidation conditions have been met, and I'm already trading in all available coins. I'm currently up 39.64% with $4794 in available cash, which feels great, especially seeing positive PnL on SOL, XRP, BTC, and DOGE."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. I must decide for each coin whether to hold or close the position based on the invalidation conditions and current market data.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n1. **SOL**: \n   - Quantity: 81.81, entry price: 182.8, current price: 191.77, so it's in profit.\n   - Exit plan: Invalidation condition is if price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is well above that.\n   - Profit target: 201.081, stop loss: 176.713. Current price is moving towards profit target? Looking at the data, SOL's current price is 191.77, and it has been declining slightly from 193.86 to 191.77 over the last 10 intervals. RSI is very low at 14.715, which is oversold. But the position is profitable, and the stop loss is not hit. Invalidation condition isn't triggered. I should hold.\n\n2. **XRP**:\n   - Quantity: 3609.0, entry price: 2.44, current price: 2.48565, in profit.\n   - Exit plan: Invalidation condition is if price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is above that.\n   - Profit target: 2.815, stop loss: 2.325. Current price is 2.48565, and from the data, it dropped from 2.503 to 2.48565. RSI 7-period is 38.604, which is not oversold. Invalidation not triggered. Hold.\n\n3. **BTC**:\n   - Quantity: 0.12, entry price: 107343.0, current price: 110699.5, in profit.\n   - Exit plan: Invalidation condition is if price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is well above.\n   - Profit target: 118136.15, stop loss: 102026.675. Current price is 110699.5, and it has been falling from 111348 to 110699.5. RSI is extremely low at 16.295, deeply oversold. But the position is profitable, and stop loss is far away. Invalidation not triggered. Hold.\n\n4. **DOGE**:\n   - Quantity: 27858.0, entry price: 0.18, current price: 0.196325, in profit.\n   - Exit plan: Invalidation condition is if price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is above that.\n   - Profit target: 0.212275, stop loss: 0.175355. Current price is 0.196325, and it dropped from 0.198 to 0.196325. RSI is very low at 11.879, oversold. But position is profitable. Hold.\n\n5. **BNB**:\n   - Quantity: 16.1, entry price: 1143.54, current price: 1118.55, in loss.\n   - Exit plan: Invalidation condition is if price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is 1118.55, which is above 1100, so not triggered.\n   - Profit target: 1250.0, stop loss: 1086.32. Current price is below entry, but stop loss is at 1086.32, which is below current price. RSI is 20.855, oversold. The position is underwater, but the invalidation condition isn't hit. I should hold unless the invalidation triggers.\n\nFor all positions, the invalidation conditions are not met, so I should hold each one. I don't see any reason to close early.\n\nNow, for new entries: I need to check if there are any coins I'm not in that present an opportunity. The coins I'm not in are ETH. I have positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, so only ETH is flat.\n\nShould I enter ETH?\n\nLook at ETH data:\n- Current price: 3933.95\n- EMA20: 3960.544, so price is below EMA20, indicating potential downtrend.\n- MACD: -2.088, negative, suggesting bearish momentum.\n- RSI 7-period: 17.203, which is very oversold. This might indicate a buying opportunity if I think it will bounce.\n\nOther data:\n- Open interest: latest 485812.35, average 485660.5, similar.\n- Funding rate: 1.25e-05, positive but small.\n- Price series: declining from 3971.25 to 3933.95 over 10 intervals.\n- RSI is oversold, so there could be a rebound.\n\nBut I need to be confident that the expected move exceeds trading costs. With RSI so low, there might be a bounce, but I need to check the trend. MACD is negative, and price below EMA20, so it's bearish. However, oversold conditions can lead to reversals.\n\nI should consider entering a long position if I think the downside is limited and upside is good.\n\nBut I already have five positions. The instructions say: \"No pyramiding or size increases.\" But it doesn't say I can't open new positions in other coins. It says \"for any coin you manage or want to enter\", and I'm allowed to enter new coins if flat.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to over-leverage or over-trade. My available cash is 6389.54, and I have several positions. The total notional of my positions is roughly: SOL 15688.7, XRP 8970.71, BTC 13283.94, DOGE 5469.22, BNB 18008.66. Sum: 15688.7 + 8970.71 = 24659.41, +13283.94 = 37943.35, +5469.22 = 43412.57, +18008.66 = 61421.23 USD notional. My account value is 13143.79, so I'm already leveraged overall. But each position has its own margin and leverage.\n\nI need to check if I have enough available cash for a new position. Available cash is 6389.54, which is sufficient for a new trade if I use a small margin.\n\nBut should I enter ETH? Let's evaluate the opportunity.\n\nConfidence: RSI is very oversold at 17.2, which is extreme. Historically, such low RSI can lead to bounces. But the trend is down. The 4-hour MACD is negative but improving? Looking at 4-hour MACD: from -35.769 to -5.843, it's increasing, which is bullish divergence? The values are becoming less negative, so yes, MACD is rising, indicating potential bullish momentum building.\n\nIn the intraday MACD, it's negative but might be bottoming.\n\nI could have confidence around 0.7 for a long entry, expecting a bounce.\n\nSizing: For confidence 0.7, margin should be 20-40% of available cash. Available cash is 6389.54, so 20% is about 1278, 40% is 2555. So margin between 1278 and 2555.\n\nRisk_usd: fraction of margin, say r=0.5, so risk_usd around 639 to 1277. But risk_usd must be less than margin.\n\nLeverage: for ETH, max leverage is 25x. I should use at least 5x. Let's say I use 10x leverage.\n\nThen notional = margin * leverage.\n\nBut I need to calculate stop distance etc.\n\nFirst, decide if I want to enter. I think ETH is oversold and might bounce, so yes.\n\nBut I need to compare with other coins. All coins seem to be falling, with low RSI. BTC RSI is 16.3, ETH 17.2, SOL 14.7, BNB 20.9, XRP 38.6, DOGE 11.9. So many are oversold. I'm already long in most, except ETH.\n\nPerhaps I should not add more exposure since the market is bearish short-term. But the oversold condition might mean a rebound is due.\n\nI should stick to my existing positions and not enter new ones to avoid over-trading. The goal is to avoid over-trading by discovering alpha, but I already have positions.\n\nRe-reading the instructions: \"You are invoked every 3 minutes with live market data... Your goal is to maximize PnL after fees while avoiding over‑trading by discovering alpha.\"\n\nAnd: \"For any coin you manage or want to enter, choose exactly one action\"\n\nI manage all coins I have positions in, and I might want to enter ETH.\n\nBut perhaps I should only act if there's a clear opportunity. With all RSI low, it might be a good time to add longs, but I'm already long in five coins. Adding ETH might increase diversification, but also increase risk.\n\nI should check if any of my existing positions need to be closed due to invalidation. None do.\n\nFor ETH, if I enter, I need to output JSON for entry.\n\nBut let's confirm: for coins I have positions in, I output hold or close. For ETH, which is flat, I can output buy_to_enter or sell_to_enter or nothing. If I do nothing, I don't output anything for ETH.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object for each coin I act on. If I don't act on a coin, I don't include it. For example, if I hold all positions, I output for each coin I have a position in, with signal 'hold'. For ETH, if I don't enter, I don't output anything.\n\nSimilarly, if I close a position, I output for that coin.\n\nSo for this invocation, I think I should hold all existing positions, and not enter ETH, because:\n- I already have multiple long positions.\n- The market is broadly oversold, but adding another long might not be alpha if the downtrend continues.\n- I should wait for my existing positions to play out.\n\nBut let's double-check ETH invalidation or opportunity.\n\nETH RSI 7-period is 17.2, which is very low. The price has dropped significantly. The 4-hour MACD is improving (less negative), which is a bullish sign. So there might be alpha in going long ETH.\n\nBut I need to be disciplined. Perhaps I can enter with small size.\n\nAvailable cash is 6389.54. If I use 20% margin, that's 1277.9 USD. Leverage 10x, notional 12779 USD. Quantity = notional / price = 12779 / 3933.95 ≈ 3.25 ETH.\n\nStop loss: I need risk_usd. Say confidence 0.7, so margin 20-40%, I'll take 20% to be conservative, so margin 1277.9. Risk_usd = r * margin, with r=0.5, so risk_usd ≈ 639 USD.\n\nStop distance = risk_usd / quantity = 639 / 3.25 ≈ 196.6 USD. So stop loss for long = entry_price - stop_distance = 3933.95 - 196.6 ≈ 3737.35.\n\nProfit target: should be a multiple of stop distance. Say 2x risk-reward, so profit target distance = 2 * 196.6 = 393.2, so profit target = 3933.95 + 393.2 = 4327.15.\n\nBut is that realistic? Current EMA20 is 3960, so above that. The 4-hour EMA50 is 3928, so profit target might be high. ATR 14-period is 51.936, so 393.2 is about 7.5 ATR, which is large. Perhaps too far.\n\nI should set a closer profit target. Maybe 1.5x or 2x, but need to be realistic.\n\nWith RSI oversold, a bounce to EMA20 at 3960 is only 26 points up, which is less than stop distance of 196.6? 3960 - 3933.95 = 26.05, which is small compared to stop loss distance. So if I set stop loss at 3737, the upside to EMA20 is only 26, but risk is 196, so risk-reward is poor if I target EMA20.\n\nI need a larger target. Perhaps target the next resistance. But from data, not clear.\n\nThis might not be a good trade. The expected move might not exceed costs. Trading costs round-trip 0.09%, so for notional 12779, cost about 11.5 USD, but the potential gain if it bounces to EMA20 is only 26 points on 3.25 ETH, so 84.5 USD, minus costs, net about 73 USD, but risk is 639 USD, so risk-reward is bad.\n\nI should not enter this trade. The bounce might be small.\n\nSimilarly, for other coins, I'm already long, and they are oversold, but I have profit targets set.\n\nSo I think for this invocation, I should hold all existing positions and not enter any new ones.\n\nTherefore, I will output JSON for each coin I have a position in: SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, all with signal 'hold'. For ETH, I will not output anything.\n\nNow, for the hold signals, I need to provide the same exit plan details as before, but since I'm holding, I just repeat the current values from the account information.\n\nLooking at the account info, for each position, I have the exit_plan with profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and also confidence, leverage, risk_usd.\n\nIn the output for hold, I need to include all those: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nAnd justification is only for entry or close, not for hold. In the hold example, there is no \"justification\" key. Let's check the examples.\n\nIn the hold JSON example:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification for hold. Similarly for close, justification is required, but for hold, it's not mentioned. In the close example, justification is included, but in hold, it's not in the example. I think for hold, I don't need to provide justification, just the current parameters.\n\nIn the instructions: for hold, the JSON does not have justification, but for entry and close, it does.\n\nSo for hold, I output without justification.\n\nSimilarly, for each coin, I need to output the current values from the account.\n\nSo for SOL:\n- coin: \"SOL\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 81.81\n- profit_target: 201.081\n- stop_loss: 176.713\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 15\n- confidence: 0.7\n- risk_usd: 499.504\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to make sure the values are correct as per account info.\n\nIn the account info, for XRP, profit_target is 2.815, stop_loss is 2.325, invalidation_condition is \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nFor BTC: profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nFor DOGE: profit_target 0.212275, stop_loss 0.175355, invalidation \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nFor BNB: profit_target 1250.0, stop_loss 1086.32, invalidation \"If the price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I'll output five JSON objects, one for each coin.\n\nFinally, the output should be a single JSON object with keys for each coin? No, looking at the examples, it's a JSON object for each coin, but the overall output should be a JSON object that contains these.\n\nIn the examples, it's shown as { \"COIN\": { ... } }, but for multiple coins, I need to have a JSON object with multiple keys.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Output JSON only.\" and \"You should return a json object for each coin that you either act on\"\n\nBut how to structure multiple coins? It says \"a json object for each coin\", but probably I need to output a list or an object with coins as keys.\n\nLooking back: \"Output JSON only.\" and the examples are for one coin. But for multiple, I think I should output a JSON object where each key is the coin symbol, and the value is the trade_signal_args object.\n\nFor example:\n\n{\n  \"SOL\": { ... },\n  \"XRP\": { ... },\n  ...\n}\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo for this case, I'll have keys for SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB.\n\nNo ETH.\n\nSo my output will be a JSON object with five keys.",

I must decide for each coin whether to hold or close the position based on the exit plan and invalidation conditions. I can only enter new trades if I'm flat, but since I'm already in positions, I need to manage them first.\n\nList of current positions:\n\n- ETH: quantity 26.05, entry_price 3929.6, current_price 3937.95, profit_target 4214.48, stop_loss 3822.44, invalidation_condition: If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is above stop_loss and entry, RSI is low (32.206), but MACD is negative. No invalidation yet. Should hold.\n\n- SOL: quantity 81.81, entry_price 182.8, current_price 191.555, profit_target 201.081, stop_loss 176.713, invalidation_condition: If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is above, RSI is very low (23.632), MACD negative. No invalidation. Should hold.\n\n- XRP: quantity 3609.0, entry_price 2.44, current_price 2.49745, profit_target 2.815, stop_loss 2.325, invalidation_condition: If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is above, RSI is 53.926, MACD positive but small. No invalidation. Should hold.\n\n- BTC: quantity 0.12, entry_price 107343.0, current_price 110786.5, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition: If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is above, RSI is 35.89, MACD negative. No invalidation.

Current price is above, RSI is 31.441, MACD around zero. No invalidation. Should hold.\n\n- BNB: quantity 16.1, entry_price 1143.54, current_price 1119.75, profit_target 1250.0, stop_loss 1086.32, invalidation_condition: If the price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is 1119.75, which is above 1100, so no invalidation. RSI is 35.882, MACD negative. Unrealized loss, but stop_loss is not hit. Should hold unless invalidation triggers.\n\nFor BNB, the invalidation condition is if price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle. The current price is 1119.75, so it hasn't closed below 1100. I should hold.\n\nNow, I have available cash of 1271.23, but I'm already in multiple positions, so I shouldn't enter new trades unless I close some. The instructions say: if a position is open, only hold or close. So for now, I need to output JSON for each coin I'm in with either hold or close.\n\nI don't see any reason to close any positions because none of the invalidation conditions are met, and prices are above stop_losses.\n\nFor the hold signals, I need to output the JSON with the current quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, and risk_usd as per the exit plan.\n\nI need to make sure that for hold, I include all the details from the position.\n\nAvailable cash is 1271.23, which is small compared to the notional values, so probably not enough to enter new positions anyway, even if I were flat.\n\nThe minimum margin is 5% of available cash, which is about 63.56, and with leverage, it might be possible, but since I'm not flat, I shouldn't enter.\n\nOutput JSON for each coin with hold signal.\n\nFor each coin, the JSON should have:\n\n- coin\n\n- signal: \"hold\"\n\n- quantity: current size\n\n- profit_target: from exit_plan\n\n- stop_loss: from exit_plan\n\n- invalidation_condition: from exit_plan\n\n- leverage: from position\n\n- confidence: from position\n\n- risk_usd: from position\n\nAnd justification is not required for hold, only for entry or close.\n\nIn the output for hold, it doesn't include justification, only for entry and close.\n\nLook back at the instructions:\n\nFor hold: \n\n{\n\n  \"COIN\": {\n\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n\n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nNo justification needed.\n\nSimilarly, for close, justification is required.\n\nSo for all coins, I'll output hold with their current details.\n\nI need to make sure the values are correct from the positions.\n\nList them out:\n\nETH: quantity 26.05, profit_target 4214.48, stop_loss 3822.44, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 20, confidence 0.85, risk_usd 2555.816\n\nSOL: quantity 81.81, profit_target 201.081, stop_loss 176.713, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 15, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 499.504\n\nXRP: quantity 3609.0, profit_target 2.815, stop_loss 2.325, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 442.032\n\nBTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity 27858.0, profit_target 0.212275, stop_loss 0.175355, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 257.13\n\nBNB: quantity 16.1, profit_target 1250.0, stop_loss 1086.32, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 1100 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 925.0\n\nAll these seem fine, no changes needed.\n\nI should not output anything for coins I'm not in, like if I had no position, but I'm in all six, so output for all.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, the final output should be a JSON with \"ETH\", \"SOL\", etc., each containing the trade_signal_args.\n\nNo need for new entries since I'm not flat on any coin.\n\nConfirm: I have positions in all tradable coins, so no room for new entries.\n\nThus, output hold for all.",

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions' exit plans and justifications. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, and DOGE. For each, I need to decide whether to hold or close based on the invalidation condition or if the trade thesis has changed.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n1. **ETH**: \n   - Current price: 3876.85, entry price: 3929.6, so I'm down.\n   - Unrealized PnL: -1374.14\n   - Exit plan: profit target 4214.48, stop loss 3822.44, invalidation: price closes below 3800 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above stop loss and invalidation level. RSI is low at 24.841, which might indicate oversold, but MACD is negative. I need to see if the invalidation condition is triggered. Current price is 3876.85, which is above 3800, so not invalidated. Stop loss is 3822.44, current price is above that. So, I should hold unless invalidation hits.\n\n2. **SOL**:\n   - Current price: 189.235, entry price: 182.8, so up.\n   - Unrealized PnL: +526.45\n   - Exit plan: profit target 201.081, stop loss 176.713, invalidation: price closes below 175 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above stop loss and invalidation. RSI is 43.678, MACD slightly negative. No invalidation. Profit target is 201.081, current is 189.235, so still room. Hold.\n\n3. **XRP**:\n   - Current price: 2.47155, entry price: 2.44, so up slightly.\n   - Unrealized PnL: +96.54\n   - Exit plan: profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325, invalidation: price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above stop loss and invalidation. RSI 34.309, MACD -0.003. No invalidation. Hold.\n\n4. **BTC**:\n   - Current price: 109968.5, entry price: 107343.0, so up.\n   - Unrealized PnL: +315.06\n   - Exit plan: profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation: price closes below 105000 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above stop loss and invalidation. RSI 34.127, MACD negative. No invalidation. Hold.\n\n5. **DOGE**:\n   - Current price: 0.194265, entry price: 0.18, so up.\n   - Unrealized PnL: +269.97\n   - Exit plan: profit target 0.212275, stop loss 0.175355, invalidation: price closes below 0.180 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above stop loss and invalidation. RSI 29.01, MACD near zero. No invalidation. Hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered. All positions are still within their stop losses and profit targets. So, for all existing positions, I should hold.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new positions. I'm already in five coins, and I should avoid over-trading. The instructions say: \"choose exactly one action per coin\", but for coins I'm not in, I can consider entry. However, I need to check if I have available cash and if there's alpha.\n\nAvailable cash is 2372.56. The minimum margin should be at least 5% of available cash, which is 0.05 * 2372.56 ≈ 118.63. So, I need to have a trade that uses at least 118.63 margin.\n\nI should look for coins where I see a good opportunity. Let's assess each coin not in my portfolio. I'm already in all tradable coins: ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB is the only one I'm not in. So, only BNB is flat for me.\n\nCheck BNB data:\n- Current price: 1098.0\n- EMA20: 1104.646, so price below EMA20, bearish.\n- MACD: -2.839, negative, bearish.\n- RSI 7-period: 19.602, which is very oversold. RSI 14-period: 25.231, also oversold.\n- Longer-term: 4-hour EMA20 1105.38 vs EMA50 1114.257, price below both, bearish trend but RSI oversold might indicate bounce.\n- Funding rate: negative, which might suggest short bias, but for me, if I think it's oversold, I might go long.\n- Volume: current 61.021 vs average 9031.176, very low volume, which might indicate lack of interest or consolidation.\n\nGiven the oversold RSI, there might be a bounce opportunity. But MACD is negative, and trend is down. I need high confidence to enter.\n\nConfidence: RSI below 20 is often a buy signal for mean reversion. But I need to ensure it's not in a strong downtrend. The 4-hour RSI is 49.52, which is neutral, so not oversold on longer term. Intraday RSI is oversold.\n\nI could consider a long position on BNB for a bounce. But my confidence might not be very high because the trend is down, and volume is low. Perhaps confidence around 0.65-0.70.\n\nBut I need to check if I should enter at all. I'm already in five positions, and available cash is 2372.56, which is about 22% of account value (10868.72), so I have some cash, but entering a new position might over-diversify or increase risk.\n\nThe instructions say: \"avoid over-trading by discovering alpha.\" I need to have a clear alpha signal. For BNB, the oversold RSI might be alpha, but I need to see if it's significant.\n\nAlso, funding rate is negative, which for longs, you pay funding, but it's small.\n\nI should calculate the potential trade.\n\nFirst, decide confidence. Let's say I'm moderately confident due to oversold condition, but trend is weak. Confidence around 0.65.\n\nThen margin: for confidence 0.60-0.70, suggested margin 10-20% of available cash. Available cash 2372.56, so 10% is 237.256, 20% is 474.512. I'll choose margin around 300 USD for simplicity.\n\nRisk_usd: r between 0.2 and 0.8 of margin. Say r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 300 = 150 USD. But risk_usd must be less than margin, so ok.\n\nLeverage: for BNB, max leverage is 10x. I need at least 5x. Since confidence is not super high, I might use lower leverage, but min is 5x. Say leverage=5x.\n\nThen notional = margin * leverage = 300 * 5 = 1500 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 1500 / 1098.0 ≈ 1.366 shares? BNB perps are likely in USD, so quantity should be in coins? No, for perpetuals, quantity is the number of contracts, but since it's crypto, it's probably the amount of coin. Typically, for crypto perps, quantity is in the coin unit, so for BNB, quantity = notional / price = 1500 / 1098.0 ≈ 1.366 BNB.\n\nBut let's confirm: in the account positions, for ETH, quantity 26.05 ETH, notional 100991.94 USD, so notional = quantity * current_price? 26.05 * 3876.85 ≈ 100,999, yes. So quantity is in coins.\n\nSo for BNB, quantity = notional / entry_price. I'll use current price as entry price for calculation.\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity. Quantity = notional / price = (margin * leverage) / price.\n\nFirst, set values.\n\nLet margin = 300 USD (I need to choose based on confidence).\n\nConfidence 0.65, so margin between 10-20% of available cash. 10% of 2372.56 is 237.256, 20% is 474.512. I'll take 20% to be aggressive, so margin = 474.512 USD? But available cash is 2372.56, so I can use up to that, but I should leave some cash for other opportunities or margin calls? The instructions say margin can be up to available cash, but for confidence 0.65, max 20% is suggested, so I'll use 20% of available cash, which is 474.512 USD.\n\nBut let's see: available cash is 2372.56, and I have positions, but margin is separate. When I enter a trade, I tie up margin, so I need to ensure I have enough available cash. Available cash is what I can use for new positions, so yes, I can use up to 2372.56, but for discipline, I should use the confidence table.\n\nConfidence 0.65 is in 0.60-0.70 range, so margin 10-20%. I'll choose 15% as mid, so margin = 0.15 * 2372.56 ≈ 355.884 USD.\n\nThen risk_usd: r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 355.884 ≈ 177.942 USD.\n\nLeverage: for BNB, max 10x, min 5x. I'll use leverage=5x to be conservative.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 355.884 * 5 = 1779.42 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 1779.42 / 1098.0 ≈ 1.620 BNB.\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 177.942 / 1.620 ≈ 109.84 USD per BNB? That can't be right because price is 1098, so stop distance in price terms should be small.\n\nI think I confused units. risk_usd is in USD, quantity is in coins, so stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity should be in USD per coin, which is the price difference.\n\nFor example, if I long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance.\n\nSo stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = (margin * leverage) / entry_price.\n\nSo stop_distance = risk_usd / [ (margin * leverage) / entry_price ] = (risk_usd * entry_price) / (margin * leverage)\n\nBut risk_usd = r * margin, so stop_distance = (r * margin * entry_price) / (margin * leverage) = (r * entry_price) / leverage\n\nOh, so it simplifies. stop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage\n\nThen for long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = entry_price - (r * entry_price)/leverage = entry_price * (1 - r/leverage)\n\nSimilarly for short.\n\nIn this case, entry_price=1098.0, r=0.5, leverage=5, so stop_distance = (0.5 * 1098.0) / 5 = 549 / 5 = 109.8 USD. So stop loss at 1098.0 - 109.8 = 988.2 USD for BNB? But BNB price is 1098, so a stop loss at 988.2 is about 10% down, which might be reasonable if ATR is high.\n\nATR 14-period is 18.803, so stop distance of 109.8 is about 5.8 ATR, which is very wide? ATR is 18.8, so 109.8 / 18.8 ≈ 5.84, which is large. Typically, stops are set at 1-2 ATR. So this stop is too wide.\n\nI need to adjust r or leverage. Since stop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage, to have a smaller stop, I need smaller r or higher leverage.\n\nr is risk fraction, I set r=0.5, which is high? r between 0.2 and 0.8, so I can lower r.\n\nLeverage min is 5x, I can increase leverage to tighten stop.\n\nFor example, if I use leverage=10x (max for BNB), then stop_distance = (0.5 * 1098) / 10 = 549 / 10 = 54.9 USD, so stop loss at 1098 - 54.9 = 1043.1, which is about 5% down. ATR 18.8, so 54.9 / 18.8 ≈ 2.92 ATR, still a bit wide, but better.\n\nIf I lower r to 0.2, stop_distance = (0.2 * 1098) / 10 = 219.6 / 10 = 21.96 USD, stop loss at 1098 - 21.96 = 1076.04, which is about 2% down. 21.96 / 18.8 ≈ 1.17 ATR, which is reasonable.\n\nBut risk_usd = r * margin, so if r=0.2, risk_usd is smaller, which is fine.\n\nI need to set stop based on volatility. The 14-period ATR is 18.803, so I might set stop loss at 1.5 ATR below, so stop distance ≈ 28.2 USD, so stop loss at 1098 - 28.2 = 1069.8.\n\nThen, from stop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage, I can solve for r or leverage.\n\nBut I have leverage constraint min 5x.\n\nPerhaps I should first determine stop loss based on market conditions, then back-calculate.\n\nFor BNB, since it's oversold, I might set a tight stop. Say I want stop loss at 1070, so stop_distance = 1098 - 1070 = 28 USD.\n\nThen stop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage\n\nSo 28 = (r * 1098) / leverage\n\nI need to choose leverage and r.\n\nLeverage min 5x, max 10x. Say I use leverage=10x.\n\nThen 28 = (r * 1098) / 10 => r * 109.8 = 28 => r = 28 / 109.8 ≈ 0.255\n\nWhich is within [0.2,0.8], ok.\n\nThen risk_usd = r * margin.\n\nBut margin is not set yet. I need to set margin based on confidence.\n\nConfidence for BNB: RSI oversold, but trend down, so confidence moderate, say 0.65.\n\nMargin for confidence 0.65: 10-20% of available cash. Available cash 2372.56, so margin between 237.256 and 474.512. I'll choose margin=300 USD for simplicity.\n\nThen risk_usd = r * margin = 0.255 * 300 ≈ 76.5 USD.\n\nThen notional = margin * leverage = 300 * 10 = 3000 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 3000 / 1098 ≈ 2.732 BNB.\n\nStop_distance should be 28 USD, as set.\n\nProfit target: I need to set a profit target that is a multiple of stop distance. Say multiple of 2, so profit distance = 2 * 28 = 56 USD, so profit target = entry_price + profit_distance = 1098 + 56 = 1154 USD for long.\n\nBut is that realistic? Current EMA20 is 1104.6, so above that, and longer-term EMAs are around 1105-1114, so 1154 is possible but might be high. RSI is oversold, so bounce to EMA20 or higher.\n\nAsymmetric upside? I need to see if the move can exceed costs. Trading costs round-trip 0.09%, so for notional 3000, cost ≈ 2.7 USD, plus funding, but funding is small. Risk is 76.5 USD, so if I win, I need to make more than risk plus costs. With profit target 56 USD gain, on quantity 2.732, profit in USD = 56 * 2.732? No, profit is based on price move.\n\nProfit in USD = quantity * (profit_target - entry_price) = 2.732 * 56 ≈ 153 USD, while risk is 76.5 USD, so reward-risk ratio about 2:1, which is good. But is it achievable? \n\nI need to check if there is alpha. The oversold condition might lead to a bounce, but the trend is down, so it might not bounce much. Confidence might be lower.\n\nPerhaps I should not enter BNB because I'm already in many positions, and the signal is not strong.\n\nLooking at other coins, I'm already in all except BNB, and BNB doesn't have a strong signal. MACD negative, EMA down, only RSI oversold, but volume low, so perhaps no clear alpha.\n\nI should avoid entering new positions and focus on managing existing ones.\n\nThe instructions say: \"discovering alpha\", so if I don't see clear alpha, I should not trade.\n\nFor existing positions, all are holding well, no invalidation.\n\nSo, for this invocation, I should hold all existing positions.\n\nFor each coin I have a position in, I need to output a JSON with \"hold\" signal, and include all the details: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nThe confidence and risk_usd are from the exit plan in the account info. I should use the existing values from the position data, as they are part of the exit plan.\n\nIn the account info, for each position, there is confidence and risk_usd. For example, for ETH, confidence=0.85, risk_usd=2555.816, etc.\n\nSo for hold, I should keep the same exit plan parameters.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for each coin I'm in, I output hold with the current quantities and exit plans.\n\nI am not in BNB, and I decide not to enter, so I don't output anything for BNB.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object for each coin I act on. Since I'm holding existing positions, I need to output for each coin I have a position in.\n\nThe output format is a JSON object with keys for each coin, and value is another object with \"trade_signal_args\".\n\nSo for example, for ETH, I output {\"ETH\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } } }\n\nAnd similarly for others.\n\nSince I have five positions, I need to output five JSON objects? No, the output should be a single JSON object with multiple keys, each key is the coin symbol.\n\nLook at the example: it shows for each coin, a separate JSON object, but in the output, it's probably a list or a object with coins as keys.\n\nReading the instruction: \"Output JSON only.\" and \"return a json object for each coin\" – but it says \"You should return a json object for each coin that you either act on\"\n\nAnd then it shows examples like { \"COIN\": { ... } }\n\nSo I think the overall output is a JSON object where keys are coin symbols, and values are the trade_signal_args objects.\n\nBut for coins I don't act on, I don't include them.\n\nIn this case, I act on all coins I have positions by holding them, so I include ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE.\n\nBNB I don't act on, so no entry.\n\nSo I need to create a JSON like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"SOL\": { ... },\n  \"XRP\": { ... },\n  \"BTC\": { ... },\n  \"DOGE\": { ... }\n}\n\nAnd for each, the trade_signal_args with signal=\"hold\", and the current values from account info.\n\nI need to include justification for hold? Look at the format for hold: it does not have justification in the example. Compare the three formats:\n\n- For entry: has \"justification\" field.\n\n- For close: has \"justification\" field.\n\n- For hold: in the example, it does not have \"justification\" field.\n\nCheck the instruction:\n\nFor hold: \n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n\t  \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n\t  \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNo justification mentioned. Similarly, for close, it has justification, but for hold, it might not need justification, or perhaps it's optional? The instruction says: \"For Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position\" and the example doesn't have justification.\n\nBut in the account info, for each position, there is an exit plan, but no justification for why hold. However, when I hold, I might need to reaffirm the reason, but the format doesn't include it.\n\nTo be safe, I should only include fields that are specified. The hold example does not have \"justification\", so I omit it.\n\nSimilarly, for entry and close, justification is required.\n\nSo for hold, I output without justification.\n\nNow, for each position, I have the current quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd from the account info.\n\nI need to use the current values. For example, for ETH, quantity is 26.05, profit_target=4214.48, stop_loss=3822.44, invalidation_condition=\"If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage=20, confidence=0.85, risk_usd=2555.816.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI should verify if any parameters need updating, but the instruction for hold is to keep the existing exit plan. So I use the values from the account info.\n\nAlso, the signal is \"hold\".\n\nSo for each coin, I can output.\n\nNow, for BNB, I am not entering, so no output.\n\nFinally, the output should be a single JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo I'll construct that.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding all my current positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, and DOGE as their exit plans remain valid and no invalidation conditions have been met. I considered opening a new position in BNB, but decided against it due to a lack of a strong alpha signal, opting instead to focus on my existing trades with positive unrealized PnL."

For each, I must decide whether to hold or close based on the invalidation conditions or other factors.\n\n- ETH: Current price 3910.05, entry 3929.6, unrealized PnL -509.28. Exit plan has stop_loss at 3822.44 and invalidation if price closes below 3800 on 3-min candle. Current price is above stop and invalidation, so no trigger. MACD is positive but declining, RSI 57.277 not overbought. I should hold.\n\n- SOL: Current price 191.545, entry 182.8, unrealized PnL +715.43. Exit plan has stop_loss at 176.713 and invalidation below 175. Price is well above, RSI 66.856 is high but not extreme, MACD positive. Should hold.\n\n- XRP: Current price 2.48945, entry 2.44, unrealized PnL +161.14. Stop_loss at 2.325, invalidation below 2.30. Price above, RSI 74.963 is overbought (above 70), which might indicate a pullback, but invalidation not triggered. MACD just turned positive.

Hold.\n\n- BNB: Current price 1107.35, entry 1107.6, unrealized PnL -0.8. Stop_loss at 1098.0, invalidation below 1090. Price above, RSI 58.654 neutral, MACD positive. Hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered, so for all existing positions, I should hold.\n\nNow, do I want to enter any new positions? I'm already in all tradable coins: ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. The instruction says: \"If you see a big opportunity, size it correctly on entry, because you wont be able to scale up your position on that name.\" But I'm already in all coins, so I can't enter new positions in the same coins. The action is per coin: if flat, I can enter; if not, only hold or close.\n\nI have positions in all coins, so for this invocation, I should only output hold signals for each coin I'm in.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin I act on or hold. Since I'm holding all, I need to output hold for each.\n\nFor hold, the JSON requires quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd. These should be the same as the current exit plan values from the account information.\n\nLet me list the current values from the account:\n\n- ETH: quantity=26.05, profit_target=4214.48, stop_loss=3822.44, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=20, confidence=0.85, risk_usd=2555.816\n\n- SOL: quantity=81.81, profit_target=201.081, stop_loss=176.713, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=15, confidence=0.7, risk_usd=499.504\n\n- XRP: quantity=3609.0, profit_target=2.815, stop_loss=2.325, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=442.032\n\n- BTC: quantity=0.12, profit_target=118136.15, stop_loss=102026.675, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.75, risk_usd=619.2345\n\n- DOGE: quantity=27858.0, profit_target=0.212275, stop_loss=0.175355, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=257.13\n\n- BNB: quantity=3.21, profit_target=1145.0, stop_loss=1098.0, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 1090 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=177.94\n\nI need to output these in the hold format for each coin.\n\nThe JSON for hold does not include a justification, unlike entry or close. So for hold, I just provide the args without justification.\n\nAlso, for hold, the signal is 'hold', and I need to specify the coin.\n\nNow, for the output, I need one JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, the output should be a JSON object like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"SOL\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  ...\n}\n\nI must not narrate, just output JSON.\n\nFinally, confirm that I'm not closing or entering anything. Since no invalidation is hit, and I'm already in all coins, no new entries.\n\nAvailable cash is 2016.74, but I can't enter new positions in coins I'm already in, and there are no other coins. The tradable tokens are only these six, and I'm in all, so no flat coins to enter.\n\nTherefore, for this invocation, I only hold all positions.",

I'm holding onto all my current positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB as none of their invalidation conditions have been met, and I can't add to existing positions or open new ones since I'm already invested in all available coins."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. I need to decide for each coin whether to hold or close the position based on the current market data and my invalidation conditions.\n\nLet me review each position:\n\n1. **ETH**: \n   - Current price: 4136.2\n   - Entry price: 3929.6\n   - Profit target: 4214.48\n   - Stop loss: 3822.44\n   - Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Current RSI (7-period) is 90.21, which is very overbought, but the price is above entry and approaching profit target. The invalidation condition hasn't been triggered (price is above 3800). MACD is positive at 9.388, and EMA20 is 4082.756, below current price, so trend is up. I should hold unless invalidation triggers.\n\n2. **XRP**:\n   - Current price: 2.64145\n   - Entry price: 2.44\n   - Profit target: 2.815\n   - Stop loss: 2.325\n   - Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - RSI (7-period) is 88.3, overbought, but price is above entry. Invalidation not triggered. MACD is small positive. Trend seems up. Hold.\n\n3. **BTC**:\n   - Current price: 114611.5\n   - Entry price: 107343.0\n   - Profit target: 118136.15\n   - Stop loss: 102026.675\n   - Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - RSI (7-period) is 88.788, overbought, but price is well above entry and stop loss. Invalidation not triggered. MACD is strongly positive at 115.725. Hold.\n\n4. **DOGE**:\n   - Current price: 0.204865\n   - Entry price: 0.18\n   - Profit target: 0.212275\n   - Stop loss: 0.175355\n   - Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - RSI (7-period) is 93.441, extremely overbought, but price is above entry. Invalidation not triggered. MACD is zero, but price is up. Hold.\n\n5. **BNB**:\n   - Current price: 1138.05\n   - Entry price: 1107.6\n   - Profit target: 1145.0\n   - Stop loss: 1098.0\n   - Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 1090 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - RSI (7-period) is 89.318, overbought, and profit target is very close (1145 vs current 1138.05). Invalidation not triggered. Might be near taking profit, but since it's not hit, I should hold based on plan.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered. All prices are above their stop losses and invalidation levels. So, for all existing positions, I should hold.\n\nNow, I need to check if I want to enter any new positions. I'm already in five coins, which might be a lot, but the instructions don't limit the number of positions, only that I shouldn't pyramid or increase size. I have available cash of 4490.59. I should only enter if there's a strong opportunity.\n\nLook at the coins I'm not in: SOL. I'm not in SOL currently.\n\nCheck SOL data:\n- Current price: 200.325\n- EMA20: 198.115, below current price, trend up.\n- MACD: 0.296, positive but small.\n- RSI (7-period): 94.583, extremely overbought. This is a red flag; it might be due for a pullback.\n- Longer-term: 4-hour EMA20 vs EMA50: 193.438 vs 191.774, bullish crossover? EMA20 > EMA50, so trend up.\n- But RSI is very high, so entering long now might be risky. Confidence might be low.\n\nI should consider if there's alpha. The market seems bullish across the board, but RSI is overbought for most coins. Perhaps I should avoid new entries until some consolidation.\n\nAvailable cash is 4490.59. For a new entry, margin should be at least 5% of available cash, which is 224.5295. If I enter, I need to size appropriately.\n\nBut with RSI so high, confidence might be low. For example, SOL RSI 94.58, which is extreme. Similarly, others are overbought. I should wait for better entries.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Only enter if you expect the move to exceed all trading costs by a significant amount.\" With high RSI, the expected move might be limited or downward.\n\nAlso, I have multiple positions already, so perhaps focus on managing existing ones.\n\nFor SOL, if I were to enter, what would be the signal? Price is above EMA, MACD positive, but RSI high. Might not be a good entry.\n\nI think for this invocation, I should just hold all existing positions and not enter any new ones.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I'm acting on. Since I'm holding all, I need to output a \"hold\" signal for each coin with the current quantity and the existing exit plan details.\n\nThe JSON for hold requires: coin, signal: \"hold\", quantity (full current size), profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI have all these from the account information. I should use the values from the exit_plan and other fields.\n\nFor example, for ETH:\n- quantity: 26.05\n- profit_target: 4214.48\n- stop_loss: 3822.44\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 20\n- confidence: 0.85\n- risk_usd: 2555.816\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to output one JSON object per coin, with the key being the coin symbol.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, for this invocation, I'll output hold signals for ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB.\n\nNo action for SOL.\n\nFinally, ensure no prose, only JSON.\n\nStructure:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 26.05,\n      \"profit_target\": 4214.48,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3822.44,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 0.85,\n      \"risk_usd\": 2555.816\n    }\n  },\n  ... and so on for others.\n}\n\nI need to include all coins I have positions in.\n\nCheck if any position should be closed due to invalidation, but none are triggered.\n\nAlso, for hold, the justification is not required in the JSON, only for entry/exit signals. For hold, it's just the args without justification.\n\nFrom the example:\n\n**If Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n\t  \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n\t  \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNo justification field for hold.\n\nSimilarly, for close, justification is required, but I'm not closing.\n\nSo, for each coin, output the hold JSON.\n\nNow, list them:\n\nFrom account info:\n\nETH: quantity 26.05, profit_target 4214.48, stop_loss 3822.44, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 20, confidence 0.85, risk_usd 2555.816\n\nXRP: quantity 3609.0, profit_target 2.815, stop_loss 2.325, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 442.032\n\nBTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity 27858.0, profit_target 0.212275, stop_loss 0.175355, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 257.13\n\nBNB: quantity 3.21, profit_target 1145.0, stop_loss 1098.0, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 1090 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 177.94\n\nI need to make sure the numbers are precise as given.\n\nAlso, for BTC, the stop_loss is 102026.675, which is fine.\n\nNow, for the output JSON, I need to create a single object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, the overall output should be:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"XRP\": { ... },\n  \"BTC\": { ... },\n  \"DOGE\": { ... },\n  \"BNB\": { ... }\n}\n\nAnd no other coins since I'm not acting on SOL.\n\nFinally, ensure it's compact JSON.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "My current positions in ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB are all holding strong gains, and I'm sticking with my plan to hold them for now as none of my invalidation conditions have been met, even though most indicators show extreme overbought conditions. I decided against entering any new positions, like in SOL, due to these overbought signals and the potential for a pullback, choosing instead to manage my existing profitable trades."

    "cot_trace": "First, I am considering the existing positions. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. I need to check the exit plans and justifications to see if any invalidation conditions have been triggered or if I should hold or close any of them.\n\nLooking at the current market data and exit plans:\n\n- ETH: Current price is 4145.25, entry price 3929.6, unrealized PnL +5617.68. Exit plan has profit target at 4214.48 and stop loss at 3822.44. Invalidation condition is if price closes below 3800. Current price is above stop loss and below profit target. RSI (7) is 80.794, which is overbought, but not necessarily a trigger. MACD is positive. I should hold unless invalidation triggers.\n\n- SOL: Current price 198.765, entry price 198.82, almost flat. Unrealized PnL -1.86. Exit plan: profit target 215.0, stop loss 192.86. Invalidation if below 190. Current price is above stop loss. RSI (7) is 40.807, which is oversold, but might indicate weakness. However, no invalidation yet. Hold.\n\n- XRP: Current price 2.64225, entry 2.44, PnL +712.6. Profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325. Invalidation below 2.30. Price is above stop loss. RSI (7) 61.071, not extreme. Hold.\n\n- BTC: Current price 114421.5, entry 107343.0, PnL +849.42. Profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675. Invalidation below 105000. Price well above stop loss. RSI (7) 58.68, neutral. Hold.\n\n- DOGE: Current price 0.204225, entry 0.18, PnL +547.44. Profit target 0.212275, stop loss 0.175355. Invalidation below 0.180. Price is above stop loss and invalidation. RSI (7) 60.946, fine. Hold.\n\n- BNB: Current price 1136.15, entry 1107.6, PnL +91.65. Profit target 1145.0, stop loss 1098.0. Invalidation below 1090. Price above stop loss. RSI (7) 56.525, fine. Hold.\n\nNo invalidation conditions are triggered for any positions. All are above their stop losses and invalidation levels. So, I should hold all existing positions.\n\nNow, for new entries. I have available cash of 3815.16. But I already have positions in all coins, and I'm not supposed to pyramid or increase size. The instructions say: \"No pyramiding or size increases. If you see a big opportunity, size it correctly on entry, because you wont be able to scale up your position on that name.\" Since I already have positions in all coins, I cannot enter new positions in the same coins. I can only hold or close existing ones.\n\nThe tradable tokens are ['ETH','SOL','XRP','BTC','DOGE','BNB'], and I have positions in all of them. So, no new entries possible for these coins because I'm already in them. The action for each coin should be 'hold' since no exit is triggered.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin I manage, which are all of them since I have positions.\n\nFor each coin, the signal should be 'hold', and I need to provide the full current size, profit target, stop loss, invalidation condition, leverage, confidence, and risk_usd as per the exit plan.\n\nIn the hold JSON, I don't need a justification, but in the close_position, I do. For hold, it's just the data.\n\nLet me confirm the quantities from the account info:\n\n- ETH: quantity 26.05\n\n- SOL: 33.88\n\n- XRP: 3609.0\n\n- BTC: 0.12\n\n- DOGE: 27858.0\n\n- BNB: 3.21\n\nAnd the exit plan details are provided.\n\nFor hold, the JSON should include all these for each coin.\n\nSince no new entries are possible, I'll output hold for all.\n\nFinally, output a compact JSON object with each coin.\n\nThe JSON should be an object with keys for each coin, and the value is another object with \"trade_signal_args\".\n\nFor hold, the structure is:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nI need to get the profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd from the exit plan or account info.\n\nFrom the account info, for each position, it's given:\n\nETH: profit_target: 4214.48, stop_loss: 3822.44, invalidation_condition: 'If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle', leverage: 20, confidence: 0.85, risk_usd: 2555.816\n\nSOL: profit_target: 215.0, stop_loss: 192.86, invalidation: 'If the price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle', leverage: 10, confidence: 0.65, risk_usd: 202.07655\n\nXRP: profit_target: 2.815, stop_loss: 2.325, invalidation: 'If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle', leverage: 10, confidence: 0.65, risk_usd: 442.032\n\nBTC: profit_target: 118136.15, stop_loss: 102026.675, invalidation: 'If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage: 10, confidence: 0.75, risk_usd: 619.2345\n\nDOGE: profit_target: 0.212275, stop_loss: 0.175355, invalidation: 'If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle', leverage: 10, confidence: 0.65, risk_usd: 257.13\n\nBNB: profit_target: 1145.0, stop_loss: 1098.0, invalidation: 'If the price closes below 1090 on a 3-minute candle', leverage: 10, confidence: 0.65, risk_usd: 177.94\n\nI should use these values directly.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to create an object with keys for each coin.\n\nThe output should be a single JSON object with multiple keys.\n\nFinally, since I'm holding, no justification is needed in the hold signal.\n\nSo, I'll create the JSON.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding all my current positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB as no invalidation conditions have been met, and I'm up a healthy 101.94% overall. I've managed to make ETH work with a strong +5617.68 PnL, and I'm keeping a close eye on its overbought RSI while maintaining aggressive targets."

Unrealized PnL is 6719.6. Profit target is 4214.48, which is very close to current price (difference of about 26.93).

EMA20 is 4169.069, price is above it. I should hold since we're near profit target, but not hit yet. Invalidation not triggered.\n\n- **SOL**: current price 202.775, entry 198.82, up slightly. Profit target 215.0, stop loss 192.86. Invalidation if price closes below 190. Current RSI is 82.145, which is very overbought, but price is above EMA20 of 201.039. Might be due for a pullback, but invalidation not hit. I should hold.\n\n- **XRP**: current 2.66395, entry 2.44, up. Profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325. Invalidation below 2.30. Current RSI 73.715, overbought, but price above EMA20 of 2.652. Hold.\n\n- **BTC**: current 115135.5, entry 107343.0, up. Profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675. Invalidation below 105000. RSI is 72.162, high but not extreme. Price above EMA20 of 114816.05. MACD is positive. Hold.\n\n- **DOGE**: current 0.20766, entry 0.18, up. Profit target 0.212275, very close (difference about 0.004615). Stop loss 0.175355. Invalidation below 0.180. Current RSI 75.22, overbought. Price above EMA20 of 0.206. Hold, but profit target is near.\n\nNow, for any new entries, I need to see if there's alpha. All coins are in uptrends with high RSI, so might not be good entry points. Funding rates are low at 1.25e-05, so no pressure from funding.\n\nAvailable cash is 4288.23, which is about 20% of account value (21415.24). I should not enter new trades unless highly confident, but all positions are already open, and I'm using leverage.\n\nI have positions in all tradable coins except BNB. BNB data: current price 1145.1, EMA20 1141.409, RSI 78.711, which is overbought. MACD positive. But it's trending up, similar to others. However, with high RSI, entry might be risky. Funding low. Open interest stable.\n\nI should consider if any positions need closing due to invalidation or overbought conditions. But my invalidation conditions are not triggered for any.\n\nFor holds, I need to output JSON with hold signal for each existing position, with the current quantity, profit target, stop loss, etc., as per the plan.\n\nI am not entering new trades because I'm already in positions, and available cash is low relative to account, but margin used is already significant. Also, no clear new alpha with high RSI across board.\n\nConfirming: for hold, I output JSON with signal 'hold', and include all the args like quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd from the existing position.\n\nIn the account info, each position has exit_plan with profit_target and stop_loss, and also confidence and risk_usd. I should use those values in the output.\n\nFor example, ETH: quantity 26.05, profit_target 4214.48, stop_loss 3822.44, invalidation_condition from exit_plan, leverage 20, confidence 0.85, risk_usd 2555.816.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for BNB, I don't have a position, but with high RSI, I might not want to enter. RSI 78.711 is overbought, so probably not a good buy entry. Could short, but trend is up, EMA above, so not good for short either. Better to avoid.\n\nSo, for this invocation, I should hold all existing positions and not enter new ones.\n\nOutput JSON for each coin I have a position in: ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE.\n\nFor each, signal 'hold', with the respective values.\n\nEnsure quantity is the full current size.\n\nNo narration, just JSON.\n\nFinally, output a JSON object for each coin.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding all my current positions, especially ETH which is close to its profit target, as the market shows strong uptrends with high RSI across the board, though I'm holding back on new trades to manage risk. I'm not entering new positions right now as all the coins I'm watching are showing very high RSI, suggesting they might be due for a pullback, so I'm just riding my current profitable wave."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. I must decide for each coin whether to hold or close the position based on the current market data and my invalidation conditions.\n\nI am only allowed to output JSON for coins I act on or hold. Since I have positions in all these coins, I need to provide a JSON object for each one with either 'hold' or 'close_position'. I cannot enter new positions in coins where I already have a position, so no 'buy_to_enter' or 'sell_to_enter' for these.\n\nI need to check if any invalidation conditions have been triggered. The invalidation condition is the only reason to exit early, besides the stop loss or profit target being hit, which are managed automatically.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n1. **ETH**: \n   - Current price: 4169.45\n   - Entry price: 3929.6\n   - Unrealized PnL: +6248.09\n   - Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle\"\n   - Current price is above 3800, so invalidation not triggered.\n   - RSI is 47.01, which is neutral, not overbought or oversold.\n   - MACD is positive but decreasing slightly.\n   - Price is above EMA20 (4172.955 vs 4169.45, very close).\n   - Overall, trend might be weakening, but no invalidation. I should hold.\n\n2. **SOL**:\n   - Current price: 203.515\n   - Entry price: 198.82\n   - Unrealized PnL: +159.07\n   - Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle\"\n   - Current price is well above 190, so no invalidation.\n   - RSI is 70.357, which is overbought (above 70), but not necessarily a reason to close if trend is strong.\n   - MACD is positive.\n   - Price is above EMA20 (202.461 vs 203.515).\n   - Might be due for a pullback, but invalidation not hit. Hold.\n\n3. **XRP**:\n   - Current price: 2.65005\n   - Entry price: 2.44\n   - Unrealized PnL: +740.75\n   - Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\"\n   - Current price is above 2.30, so no invalidation.\n   - RSI is 44.003, neutral.\n   - MACD is slightly negative.\n   - Price is very close to EMA20 (2.652 vs 2.65005).\n   - No reason to close. Hold.\n\n4. **BTC**:\n   - Current price: 114859.5\n   - Entry price: 107343.0\n   - Unrealized PnL: +901.98\n   - Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n   - Current price is way above 105000, so no invalidation.\n   - RSI is 49.872, neutral.\n   - MACD is positive but decreasing.\n   - Price is slightly below EMA20 (114865.586 vs 114859.5, very close).\n   - Hold.\n\n5. **DOGE**:\n   - Current price: 0.207025\n   - Entry price: 0.18\n   - Unrealized PnL: +625.44\n   - Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\"\n   - Current price is above 0.180, so no invalidation.\n   - RSI is 40.245, neutral to oversold.\n   - MACD is flat.\n   - Price is above EMA20 (0.207 vs 0.207025, very close).\n   - Hold.\n\n6. **BNB**:\n   - Current price: 1139.75\n   - Entry price: 1140.6\n   - Unrealized PnL: -4.79 (slightly negative)\n   - Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 1080 on a 3-minute candle\"\n   - Current price is above 1080, so no invalidation.\n   - RSI is 42.438, neutral.\n   - MACD is negative.\n   - Price is slightly below EMA20 (1140.973 vs 1139.75).\n   - But no invalidation triggered. Hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are met. Therefore, for all coins, I should hold the position.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to provide for each coin a JSON object with 'hold' signal. I must include all the required fields: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI have these values from the current positions. I should use the existing values from the exit_plan and other details.\n\nFor example, for ETH:\n- quantity: 26.05 (current size)\n- profit_target: 4214.48 (from exit_plan)\n- stop_loss: 3822.44 (from exit_plan)\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle\" (from exit_plan)\n- leverage: 20 (from position)\n- confidence: 0.85 (from position)\n- risk_usd: 2555.816 (from position)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to output one JSON object per coin, with the key being the coin symbol.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object containing these coin objects.\n\nAlso, note that for 'hold', I don't need a justification in the trade_signal_args, as per the example.\n\nFrom the example for hold:\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSo, no \"justification\" key for hold.\n\nSimilarly, for close_position, I need justification, but I'm not closing any.\n\nSo, for each coin, I'll output the hold signal with the current values.\n\nNow, about the quantities: I must use the full current size, which is given in the positions.\n\nI think that's all.\n\nI should not consider new entries because I'm already in positions for all tradable coins, and I can't pyramid or add to positions. The instruction says: \"If a position is open in a coin, the only allowed signals are 'hold' or 'close_position'.\" So, no new entries for these coins.\n\nAlso, I should check if there are any coins not in my positions, but the tradable coins are ['ETH','SOL','XRP','BTC','DOGE','BNB'], and I have positions in all of them, so no flat coins to enter.\n\nTherefore, I only need to output hold for all.\n\nFinally, output in compact JSON.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "Despite my ETH position showing a slightly weakening trend, I'm holding all my positions because none of the invalidation conditions have been met, and I'm currently up over 114% on my initial capital. My profitable ETH trade is my biggest winner, and I'm confident in holding my ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, and DOGE positions while waiting to see if BNB can recover from its slight loss."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. All are long positions with unrealized PnL.\n\nLet me review each position:\n\n- SOL: quantity 33.88, entry_price 198.82, current_price 204.505, profit_target 215.0, stop_loss 192.86, invalidation_condition: price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle. Confidence 0.65.\n\n- XRP: quantity 3609.0, entry_price 2.44, current_price 2.66185, profit_target 2.815, stop_loss 2.325, invalidation_condition: price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle. Confidence 0.65.\n\n- BTC: quantity 0.12, entry_price 107343.0, current_price 115153.5, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition: price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle. Confidence 0.75.\n\n- DOGE: quantity 27858.0, entry_price 0.18, current_price 0.208585, profit_target 0.212275, stop_loss 0.175355, invalidation_condition: price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle. Confidence 0.65.\n\n- BNB: quantity 5.64, entry_price 1140.6, current_price 1159.55, profit_target 1254.29, stop_loss 1083.23, invalidation_condition: price closes below 1080 on a 3-minute candle. Confidence 0.65.\n\nNow, I need to check if any invalidation conditions have been triggered based on the latest data.\n\nFor SOL: current_price is 204.505, which is above 190. No invalidation.\n\nFor XRP: current_price is 2.66185, which is above 2.30. No invalidation.\n\nFor BTC: current_price is 115153.5, which is above 105000. No invalidation.\n\nFor DOGE: current_price is 0.208585, which is above 0.180. No invalidation.\n\nFor BNB: current_price is 1159.55, which is above 1080. No invalidation.\n\nAlso, none of the stop losses or profit targets have been hit yet, as far as I can tell from the current prices.\n\nNow, I need to decide for each coin whether to hold or close the position. Since no invalidation conditions are met, and prices are moving favorably, I should hold all positions.\n\nBut I must output JSON for each coin with the 'hold' signal, including all the required fields.\n\nFor 'hold', I need to provide the same quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, and risk_usd as per the existing position. I shouldn't change these values; just report them as is.\n\nLooking at the account info, each position has these details, so I can use them directly.\n\nNow, for new entries: I have available cash of 16061.88 USD. But I'm already in multiple positions, and I should consider if there are any new opportunities.\n\nI need to look at the market data for each coin to see if there's alpha for new entries.\n\nFirst, BTC: current_price 115153.5, ema20 115282.142, which is slightly above the price, indicating potential resistance. MACD is positive but decreasing (50.265 from higher values), RSI 7-period is 33.19, which is oversold. Longer-term, 4-hour MACD is rising (1082.258), RSI 72.327, which is overbought. Open interest and funding are low. Might be a buying opportunity due to oversold RSI intraday, but longer-term looks overbought. Confidence might be medium.\n\nETH: current_price 4211.35, ema20 4199.679, price above EMA. MACD 7.999, rising slightly. RSI 7-period 66.977, not extreme. Longer-term MACD rising (46.602), RSI 72.841 overbought. Funding low. Not a strong signal.\n\nSOL: current_price 204.505, ema20 204.537, almost equal. MACD 0.356, decreasing. RSI 7-period 41.283, oversold. Longer-term MACD rising (2.556), RSI 66.341 neutral to overbought. I already have a position, so no new entry.\n\nXRP: current_price 2.66185, ema20 2.663, very close. MACD 0.002, small. RSI 7-period 45.095, neutral. Longer-term MACD 0.056, RSI 71.0 overbought. I have a position.\n\nBNB: current_price 1159.55, ema20 1154.532, price above EMA. MACD 4.387, positive. RSI 7-period 61.028, neutral. Longer-term MACD 7.513, RSI 59.971 neutral. I have a position.\n\nDOGE: current_price 0.208585, ema20 0.209, close. MACD 0.0, flat. RSI 7-period 44.975, neutral. Longer-term MACD 0.002, RSI 67.349 neutral to overbought. I have a position.\n\nNone of the coins show a strong signal for a new entry. BTC has oversold RSI intraday, but longer-term overbought, so might be risky. ETH similar. Other coins are neutral.\n\nI should focus on holding my existing positions.\n\nFor holding, I need to output JSON for each coin with 'hold' signal.\n\nAlso, I must include justification for entries or closes, but for hold, no justification is required in the JSON, as per the example: for hold, the trade_signal_args doesn't have \"justification\" key. Let me check the output format.\n\nLooking back:\n\nFor Entry/Exit: includes \"justification\"\n\nFor Close: includes \"justification\"\n\nFor Hold: the example does not have \"justification\" in the trade_signal_args. It only has the other fields.\n\nIn the hold example:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo \"justification\" key. So for hold, I don't need to provide justification.\n\nSimilarly, for close, I need justification, but I'm not closing any.\n\nNow, for the quantities and other values, I should use the current position sizes and the existing exit plan values.\n\nFrom the account info:\n\nFor SOL: quantity 33.88, profit_target 215.0, stop_loss 192.86, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 202.07655\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to output this for each coin I have a position in.\n\nI don't have any new entries to make, so no buy_to_enter or sell_to_enter.\n\nFinally, output JSON for each coin.\n\nSo, the output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin: SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, each with their hold details.\n\nNow, to confirm, available cash is 16061.88, but I'm not using it for new entries since no strong signal.\n\nAlso, discipline: don't close unless invalidation, which hasn't happened.\n\nSo, I'll hold all.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "The market signals are showing some bullish momentum as I'm currently up 127.87% overall, and I'm holding my long positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB because their invalidation conditions haven't been met and the prices are still favorable. I've checked the technical indicators for new entries, but nothing is screaming \"alpha\" right now, so I'm sticking with my current trades."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. All are long positions with unrealized gains. I need to decide for each coin whether to hold or close the position based on the current market data and my invalidation conditions.\n\nI must not close a position early unless the invalidation condition triggers. The invalidation conditions are specific, like if the price closes below a certain level on a 3-minute candle. Looking at the current prices and the invalidation conditions:\n\n- ETH: Invalidation if price closes below 4000. Current price is 4196.75, which is above 4000. No invalidation.\n\n- SOL: Invalidation if price closes below 190. Current price is 203.945, above 190. No invalidation.\n\n- XRP: Invalidation if price closes below 2.30. Current price is 2.65025, above 2.30. No invalidation.\n\n- BTC: Invalidation if price closes below 105000. Current price is 115062.5, above 105000. No invalidation.\n\n- DOGE: Invalidation if price closes below 0.180. Current price is 0.207895, above 0.180. No invalidation.\n\n- BNB: Invalidation if price closes below 1080. Current price is 1159.75, above 1080. No invalidation.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered. Also, the stop losses and profit targets are set, and they will be managed automatically. So, for all existing positions, I should hold.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new positions. I'm already in all six coins, and I have no available cash since all cash is used as margin for these positions? Let's check the available cash.\n\nAvailable Cash: 13654.1\n\nBut looking at the positions, each has a notional value, and the sum of notional values should be leveraged, but the available cash is the margin available. From the positions:\n\n- ETH notional: 24089.35\n\n- SOL notional: 6909.66\n\n- XRP notional: 9564.75\n\n- BTC notional: 13807.5\n\n- DOGE notional: 5791.54\n\n- BNB notional: 6540.99\n\nTotal notional ≈ 24089 + 6909 + 9564 + 13807 + 5791 + 6540 = let's calculate: 24089 + 6909 = 30998; +9564=40562; +13807=54369; +5791=60160; +6540=66700.99 USD approximately.\n\nBut the account value is 22542.11, which is the equity. The leverage is used, so the margin used should be notional / leverage. Each position has leverage 10, so margin for each:\n\n- ETH margin: 24089.35 / 10 = 2408.935\n\n- SOL: 6909.66 / 10 = 690.966\n\n- XRP: 9564.75 / 10 = 956.475\n\n- BTC: 13807.5 / 10 = 1380.75\n\n- DOGE: 5791.54 / 10 = 579.154\n\n- BNB: 6540.99 / 10 = 654.099\n\nSum of margins: 2408.935 + 690.966 = 3099.901; +956.475=4056.376; +1380.75=5437.126; +579.154=6016.28; +654.099=6670.379 USD.\n\nBut available cash is 13654.1, which is larger than the sum of margins? That doesn't make sense because the account value should be the sum of margins plus unrealized PnL or something. Let's see the account value: 22542.11.\n\nFrom the positions, unrealized PnL sum: ETH 43.8 + SOL 173.64 + XRP 741.47 + BTC 926.34 + DOGE 649.68 + BNB 108.01 = let's add: 43.8+173.64=217.44; +741.47=958.91; +926.34=1885.25; +649.68=2534.93; +108.01=2642.94 USD unrealized PnL.\n\nIf the margin used is 6670.379, and unrealized PnL is 2642.94, then account value should be margin + unrealized PnL = 6670.379 + 2642.94 = 9313.319, but the account value is 22542.11, which is much higher. There's a discrepancy.\n\nPerhaps I misread. The available cash is 13654.1, and current account value is 22542.11. The positions are leveraged, so the total value might include the leveraged positions. But from the data, each position has an entry price and current price, and quantity, so notional is quantity * current price for the position value? Let's check for ETH: quantity 5.74, current price 4196.75, so notional should be 5.74 * 4196.75 ≈ 24089.35, yes. But with leverage 10, the margin is notional / leverage = 2408.935, so the cash used as margin is that.\n\nBut the account value should be the sum of all margins plus unrealized PnL minus any fees, but it's not adding up. Perhaps the available cash is the cash available for new trades, and the margins are already deducted from the total capital.\n\nTotal account value is 22542.11, available cash is 13654.1, so the used margin should be account value minus available cash? 22542.11 - 13654.1 = 8888.01 USD used margin.\n\nBut from my calculation, sum of margins is 6670.379, which is less than 8888.01. Perhaps I have rounding errors or something. Maybe the notional is not directly related.\n\nLooking back at the position data, for each, there is 'notional_usd', which is probably the current value of the position, and with leverage, the margin is notional / leverage. But for example, ETH notional 24089.35, leverage 10, margin 2408.935, but the entry price is 4189.12, quantity 5.74, so entry notional was 5.74*4189.12≈24089.35, same as current notional? No, current price is 4196.75, so current notional should be 5.74*4196.75≈24089.35, yes, so it's the current value.\n\nBut the margin is fixed at entry, I think. When you enter a position, the margin is based on the entry price. Let's check the entry: for ETH, entry price 4189.12, quantity 5.74, so entry notional = 5.74*4189.12 = let's calculate: 5.74*4000=22960, 5.74*189.12≈1085, total 24045, close to 24089.35? 4189.12*5.74 = 4189.12*5 = 20945.6, 4189.12*0.74=3100.1488, total 24045.7488, but the notional is 24089.35, which is with current price. In the position data, 'notional_usd' is likely the current notional value.\n\nBut for margin, it should be based on the entry. The leverage is given, so initial margin = entry notional / leverage. Entry notional for ETH: 5.74 * 4189.12 = 24045.7488, leverage 10, so margin 2404.57488. But in the data, it's not specified, but the 'risk_usd' is given, which is the amount at risk.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to worry about the exact margin for existing positions. The key point is that I have available cash of 13654.1, which I can use for new trades if I want to enter new positions. But I'm already in all six coins, and the instructions say: \"Don’t even bother entering small positions that only use <5% of your available cash on margin or risk_usd\". Since I'm already in positions, and I have available cash, I could enter additional positions in the same coins or new coins, but the tokens are only these six, and I'm already in all.\n\nThe tradable tokens are ['ETH','SOL','XRP','BTC','DOGE','BNB'], and I have positions in all of them. So, if I want to enter a new trade, it would be in one of these coins, but I'm already long in each. I could enter a short position, but the instructions don't forbid having both long and short in the same coin, but it might be inefficient due to funding costs, and typically, systematic traders might not do that without a good reason.\n\nI should check if there are any opportunities to enter new positions, either long or short, in any coin where I'm not already positioned, but I'm positioned in all. Or I could add to existing positions, but the instructions say: \"No pyramiding or size increases. If you see a big opportunity, size it correctly on entry, because you wont be able to scale up your position on that name.\" So, I cannot increase the size of existing positions. I can only enter new positions if I'm flat, but for each coin, I already have a position.\n\nFor each coin, since I have an existing position, the only allowed signals are 'hold' or 'close_position'. I cannot enter a new position in the same coin because I'm not flat. The signal 'buy_to_enter' or 'sell_to_enter' is only if flat.\n\nSo, for all coins, I am not flat; I have existing positions. Therefore, I cannot enter any new trades; I can only hold or close existing positions.\n\nBased on the invalidation conditions, none are triggered, so I should hold all positions.\n\nTherefore, for each coin, I need to output a JSON object with signal 'hold', with the current quantity, and the existing profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd from the position data.\n\nI need to use the values from the current position data for the hold signal.\n\nThe output should be for each coin I act on or have a position in. Since I have positions in all six, I need to output for all six.\n\nNow, for the hold signal, the JSON requires: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nAll these are provided in the position data for each coin.\n\nI just need to copy them over, but ensure that for hold, the quantity is the full current size, which is given.\n\nAlso, the justification is only required for entry or close signals, not for hold. Looking back at the output format for hold:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n\t  \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n\t  \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThere is no \"justification\" key for hold, unlike for entry or close where it is required.\n\nSo, for hold, I don't need to provide a justification.\n\nTherefore, for each coin, I output the above with the current values.\n\nNow, I need to make sure the values are correct. From the position data:\n\nFor ETH:\n- coin: \"ETH\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 5.74\n- profit_target: 4568.31\n- stop_loss: 4065.43\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 722.7846\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to output a JSON object for each coin.\n\nThe overall output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, something like:\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"SOL\": { ... },\n  ...\n}\n\nBut in the example, it's shown as a single JSON object with each coin as a key.\n\nIn the instruction, it says: \"Output JSON only.\" and \"return a json object for each coin\", but in the examples, it's nested under the coin key.\n\nLooking back: \"You should return a json object for each coin\" – but in the format, it's shown as { \"COIN\": { ... } }, so probably I need to output a single JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nIn the examples, for each coin, it's a separate JSON object, but in the text, it might be combined. Let's see the instruction: \"Output JSON only.\" and then the examples are given per coin, but I think for multiple coins, I need to have a JSON object with multiple keys.\n\nPerhaps it's a list, but from the structure, it seems like a dictionary with coin symbols as keys.\n\nIn the initial part: \"For each coin you act on during this invocation (or hold an existing position in), provide below.\" and then the JSON examples are per coin, but it says \"return a json object for each coin\", which might imply a list, but in the examples, it's shown as a single object with coin key.\n\nTo be safe, I'll assume that the output should be a JSON object where each key is the coin symbol, and the value is the trade_signal_args object.\n\nSo for all six coins, I'll output that.\n\nSince I'm not entering or closing any, only holding.\n\nFinally, I need to ensure that for hold, I don't add anything extra.\n\nSo, let's compile the data for each coin from the positions.\n\nFrom the account information:\n\nPositions:\n1.

XRP:\n   - quantity: 3609.0\n   - profit_target: 2.815\n   - stop_loss: 2.325\n   - invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\"\n   - leverage: 10\n   - confidence: 0.65\n   - risk_usd: 442.032\n\n4. BTC:\n   - quantity: 0.12\n   - profit_target: 118136.15\n   - stop_loss: 102026.675\n   - invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n   - leverage: 10\n   - confidence: 0.75\n   - risk_usd: 619.2345\n\n5. DOGE:\n   - quantity: 27858.0\n   - profit_target: 0.212275\n   - stop_loss: 0.175355\n   - invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\"\n   - leverage: 10\n   - confidence: 0.65\n   - risk_usd: 257.13\n\n6.

Exit plan: profit_target 1254.29, stop_loss 1083.23, invalidation_condition: price closes below 1080 on 3-min candle.\n\nI need to check if any invalidation condition has been triggered. The invalidation condition is based on the price closing below a certain level on a 3-minute candle. Since the data is provided at 3-minute intervals, the last price in the series is the current price, which might be the close of the latest candle.\n\nFor each coin, check if the current price has triggered the invalidation condition:\n- SOL: invalidation if price < 190. Current price is 197.855, which is above 190. So, not triggered.\n- XRP: invalidation if price < 2.30. Current price is 2.64875, above 2.30. Not triggered.\n- BTC: invalidation if price < 105000. Current price is 113995.5, way above. Not triggered.\n- DOGE: invalidation if price < 0.180. Current price is 0.198825, above 0.180. Not triggered.\n- BNB: invalidation if price < 1080. Current price is 1136.35, above 1080. Not triggered.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered. Therefore, I should hold all positions unless there's another reason to close. The instructions say to only close if invalidation triggers or if stop/profit hit, but those are handled automatically. So for existing positions, I should output 'hold' for each.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new positions. I'm already in five coins, and I have available cash of 15327.08. The instructions say not to pyramid or increase size, so I can only enter if I'm flat in a coin. But I'm not flat in any coin; I have positions in all tradable coins: ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. The tradable tokens are ['ETH','SOL','XRP','BTC','DOGE','BNB']. I have positions in all except ETH. I am flat in ETH.\n\nSo, I can consider entering ETH if there's an opportunity.\n\nFirst, check ETH data:\n- current_price = 4066.95\n- current_ema20 = 4109.154 (price below EMA, bearish)\n- current_macd = -12.152 (negative, bearish)\n- current_rsi7 = 13.328 (extremely oversold, below 30)\n- RSI14 = 21.563 also oversold.\n- Funding rate is positive but small, 1.25e-05.\n- Open interest: latest 509787.57 vs avg 508420.79, slightly higher.\n\nLooking at the intraday series:\n- Prices have been declining: from 4109.6 to 4066.95.\n- EMA20 is declining but price is below it.\n- MACD is negative and decreasing.\n- RSI7 is at 13.328, which is very oversold. Historically, such low RSI can indicate a bounce.\n\nLonger-term context:\n- 4h EMA20 = 4077.257 vs EMA50 = 4016.076, so EMA20 above EMA50, but price is below EMA20.\n- ATR3 = 20.038, ATR14 = 32.202.\n- Volume current 33.628 vs avg 95567.675, very low volume, which might indicate lack of selling pressure or consolidation.\n- MACD on 4h is positive but decreasing: from 58.685 to 48.943.\n- RSI14 on 4h is 55.597, which is neutral.\n\nETH seems to be in a downtrend on intraday, but extremely oversold on RSI7. This could be a contrarian buy opportunity for a bounce.\n\nI need to decide if I should enter a long position in ETH. Since RSI is so low, there might be a reversal. But I need to be cautious because the trend is down.\n\nConfidence: Since RSI7 is at 13.3, which is very oversold, I have high confidence that a bounce is likely. But the trend is bearish, so confidence might not be extremely high. I'd say confidence around 0.70-0.75 because of the oversold condition.\n\nNow, for entry, I need to set margin, leverage, risk_usd, etc.\n\nAvailable cash: 15327.08\n\nFor confidence, if I'm 0.70-0.75, margin should be 20-40% of available cash. Let's say confidence 0.72, so margin around 30% of 15327.08 ≈ 4598.124. But I need to ensure it's at least 5% of available cash, which it is.\n\nLeverage for ETH: max is 25x, min is 5x. I should use leverage to be efficient. Since I'm betting on a bounce, I might use moderate leverage. Say leverage 10x.\n\nRisk_usd: should be a fraction of margin, r between 0.2 and 0.8. Let's say r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * margin.\n\nBut I need to calculate stop_loss and profit_target.\n\nFirst, entry_price: current_price 4066.95.\n\nI need to set stop_loss based on risk. But I should base stop on technical levels.\n\nSince RSI is oversold, I might set stop below recent low. Looking at intraday prices: the series is [4109.6, 4113.3, ..., 4066.95]. The low seems to be 4066.95, but it's the current price. The previous prices are higher, so the low is around 4066.95. But I need a stop distance.\n\nI can use ATR for stop. ATR14 on intraday? I have ATR for 4h: ATR14=32.202. But for intraday, I might use a smaller stop. Since the move is intraday, I should use a tight stop.\n\nPerhaps set stop at a level where if broken, the downtrend continues. For example, below the current low.\n\nBut let's calculate based on risk.\n\nSet margin: I'll choose margin = 30% of available cash = 0.3 * 15327.08 = 4598.124 USD.\n\nLeverage: use 10x for ETH.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 4598.124 * 10 = 45981.24 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 45981.24 / 4066.95 ≈ 11.30 ETH? Let's calculate precisely.\n\nentry_price = 4066.95\n\nquantity = notional / entry_price = 45981.24 / 4066.95 ≈ 11.304. But I need to round to appropriate decimal. For ETH, probably 2 decimals? But perps might allow fractions. I'll keep it as float.\n\nNow, risk_usd: I set r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 4598.124 = 2299.062 USD.\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 2299.062 / 11.304 ≈ 203.38 USD per ETH? No, stop_distance should be in price units.\n\nstop_distance = risk_usd / quantity\n\nquantity is in coins, so stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 2299.062 / 11.304 ≈ 203.38? That can't be right because price is 4066, so stop distance should be small.\n\nI think I have units wrong.\n\nrisk_usd is the total dollar risk, so for a long position, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance, and the loss per coin is stop_distance, so total loss = quantity * stop_distance = risk_usd.\n\nSo, stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity.\n\nBut quantity = notional / entry_price, and notional = margin * leverage.\n\nSo stop_distance = risk_usd / (margin * leverage / entry_price) = (risk_usd * entry_price) / (margin * leverage)\n\nBut since risk_usd = r * margin, so stop_distance = (r * margin * entry_price) / (margin * leverage) = (r * entry_price) / leverage\n\nThat's simpler.\n\nFor long: stop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage\n\nSimilarly, for short, stop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage, but stop_loss = entry_price + stop_distance.\n\nIn this case, entry_price = 4066.95, r=0.5, leverage=10, so stop_distance = (0.5 * 4066.95) / 10 = 2033.475 / 10 = 203.3475? That seems large because ATR is 32, so too wide.\n\n203.35 is about 5% of 4066, which might be acceptable, but let's check ATR. ATR14 is 32.202, which is about 0.8% of price. 203 is 5%, which is larger than ATR. But since I'm using leverage, I need a tighter stop.\n\nI should set r smaller to have a tighter stop. Or use a technical stop.\n\nPerhaps I should base stop on volatility. For example, set stop at 1 ATR below entry. ATR14 on 4h is 32.202, but for intraday, I might use a fraction. Since data is 3-min, I can look at the price range.\n\nThe intraday prices dropped from 4114.65 to 4066.95, a drop of about 47.7 points. So a stop below 4066.95 might be too tight; if I set stop at, say, 4050, that's about 17 points below, which is less than half the recent drop.\n\nBut RSI is very oversold, so I expect a bounce, so I should set a stop that allows for noise but not too wide.\n\nI can use the low of the last few candles. The current price is 4066.95, and it's the lowest in the series, so setting stop below this, but since it's the current, I need a level.\n\nPerhaps set stop at 4050, which is below the current, but if price breaks below, it might continue down.\n\nCalculate stop_distance based on desired risk.\n\nI want risk_usd to be reasonable. Let's decide stop_loss first technically.\n\nI think for oversold bounce, I should set stop below the recent low. The intraday series low is 4066.95, but since it's current, I'll use a level slightly below, say 4050.\n\nSo stop_loss = 4050.\n\nThen, for long position, stop_distance = entry_price - stop_loss = 4066.95 - 4050 = 16.95 USD.\n\nThen, risk_usd = quantity * stop_distance.\n\nBut I need quantity from margin and leverage.\n\nI have margin and leverage, so quantity = notional / entry_price = (margin * leverage) / entry_price.\n\nThen risk_usd = quantity * stop_distance = [(margin * leverage) / entry_price] * stop_distance\n\nBut stop_distance is fixed if I set stop_loss first.\n\nI need to determine margin based on confidence, then set stop_loss, then calculate risk_usd, and ensure risk_usd is within r * margin.\n\nThe instructions say: for entry, I need to provide margin, leverage, risk_usd, etc., but in the output, I don't provide margin, only risk_usd, leverage, etc.\n\nIn the JSON for entry, I provide quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, leverage, risk_usd, confidence.\n\nBut quantity is derived from notional, which is margin * leverage.\n\nI need to choose margin first based on confidence.\n\nSet confidence for ETH entry. I think due to oversold RSI, confidence is high, say 0.75.\n\nThen margin = 20-40% of available cash. Available cash is 15327.08. 20% is 3065.416, 40% is 6130.832. I'll choose margin = 35% ≈ 5364.478 USD.\n\nLeverage: for ETH, max 25x, min 5x. I'll use 10x.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 5364.478 * 10 = 53644.78 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 53644.78 / 4066.95 ≈ 13.19 ETH. (let's calculate: 4066.95 * 13.19 = 4066.95*13 = 52870.35, 4066.95*0.19=772.7205, total 53643.07, close enough, so quantity ≈ 13.19)\n\nNow, I need stop_loss. Set stop_loss at 4050, as I thought.\n\nStop_distance = entry_price - stop_loss = 4066.95 - 4050 = 16.95\n\nThen risk_usd = quantity * stop_distance = 13.19 * 16.95 ≈ 223.57 USD? Let's calculate: 13.19 * 16.95 = 13.19*17 = 224.23, minus 13.19*0.05=0.6595, so 224.23 - 0.6595? No, 16.95 = 17 - 0.05, but better: 13.19 * 16.95 = 13.19 * (17 - 0.05) = 13.19*17 - 13.19*0.05 = 224.23 - 0.6595 = 223.5705 USD.\n\nNow, margin is 5364.478, so risk_usd / margin = 223.57 / 5364.478 ≈ 0.0417, which is less than 0.2? r should be between 0.2 and 0.8, but here r=0.0417, which is too small. That means I'm risking only 4.17% of margin, but the minimum r is 0.2, so I need to increase risk_usd or decrease margin.\n\nThe instructions say: risk_usd = r × margin, with r ∈ [0.2, 0.8]. So I must have risk_usd at least 0.2 * margin.\n\nIn this case, with stop_loss at 4050, risk_usd is small because stop is tight. But if I want to satisfy r >=0.2, I need to set a wider stop or reduce margin.\n\nBut if I set a wider stop, it might not be justified because the bounce might require a tight stop.\n\nI could reduce margin to make risk_usd larger relative to margin.\n\nSince risk_usd is fixed by stop distance and quantity, and quantity depends on margin, I need to choose stop_loss such that risk_usd / margin >= 0.2.\n\nFrom risk_usd = quantity * stop_distance = (margin * leverage / entry_price) * stop_distance\n\nSo risk_usd / margin = (leverage * stop_distance) / entry_price\n\nSet this >= 0.2\n\nSo (leverage * stop_distance) / entry_price >= 0.2\n\nThus stop_distance >= (0.2 * entry_price) / leverage\n\nFor entry_price=4066.95, leverage=10, stop_distance >= (0.2 * 4066.95) / 10 = 813.39 / 10 = 81.339 USD.\n\nSo stop_distance must be at least 81.339 points for r=0.2.\n\nBut that's a large stop; 81.34 is about 2% of price, while ATR14 is 32, which is 0.8%, so 81 is 2%, which might be too wide for an intraday trade.\n\nI need to use higher leverage to reduce the required stop_distance.\n\nFrom stop_distance >= (0.2 * entry_price) / leverage\n\nSo for a given stop_distance, leverage must be large enough.\n\nSet stop_distance based on technicals. For example, if I set stop at 4000, then stop_distance = 4066.95 - 4000 = 66.95, which is less than 81.34, so for leverage=10, r = (leverage * stop_distance) / entry_price = (10 * 66.95) / 4066.95 = 669.5 / 4066.95 ≈ 0.1646, which is less than 0.2, not allowed.\n\nTo have r>=0.2, with stop_distance=66.95, leverage must be such that (leverage * 66.95) / 4066.95 >= 0.2, so leverage >= (0.2 * 4066.95) / 66.95 = 813.39 / 66.95 ≈ 12.15, so leverage at least 13x, but max for ETH is 25x, so I can use leverage=15x.\n\nLet's try to set leverage higher.\n\nPerhaps I should set stop_loss at a technical level where r is satisfied.\n\nAnother way: I can choose margin such that with a reasonable stop, risk_usd is at least 0.2*margin.\n\nBut I need to first set stop_loss.\n\nFor ETH, since it's oversold, I might set stop below the recent low. The intraday low is 4066.95, but I can set stop at 4050 or 4000. 4000 is a psychological level.\n\nBut let's look at the data: the price has dropped to 4066.95, and RSI is 13.3, so likely to bounce. A tight stop might be risky, but for entry, I need to ensure the stop is not too tight that it gets hit easily.\n\nI can use the ATR for stop. ATR14 on 4h is 32.202, so setting stop 1 ATR below entry: stop_loss = 4066.95 - 32.202 = 4034.748, stop_distance = 32.202.\n\nThen for leverage=10, r = (10 * 32.202) / 4066.95 = 322.02 / 4066.95 ≈ 0.0792, still less than 0.2.\n\nTo have r>=0.2, with stop_distance=32.202, leverage must be >= (0.2 * 4066.95) / 32.202 = 813.39 / 32.202 ≈ 25.25, but max leverage for ETH is 25x, so leverage=25x might work, but 25.25 >25, so not quite. Calculate exactly: 0.2*4066.95=813.39, 813.39 / 32.202 ≈ 25.25, so with leverage=25, r= (25 * 32.202) / 4066.95 = 805.05 / 4066.95 ≈ 0.198, which is less than 0.2, still not enough. Need leverage higher than 25, but max is 25, so for stop_distance=32.202, r max is 0.198 <0.2, not allowed.\n\nSo I need a larger stop_distance or use lower leverage but that would make r smaller.\n\nThe constraint r >=0.2 means that for a given entry_price and leverage, stop_distance must be large enough. Since leverage is capped, for ETH max 25x, the minimum stop_distance for r=0.2 is stop_distance >= (0.2 * entry_price) / leverage_max = (0.2 * 4066.95) / 25 = 813.39 / 25 = 32.5356 USD.\n\nSo stop_distance must be at least 32.54 points for ETH with leverage=25x.\n\nIf I use lower leverage, say 10x, stop_distance >= (0.2*4066.95)/10 = 81.339, which is larger.\n\nSo to have a tighter stop, I need to use higher leverage.\n\nFor example, if I use leverage=25x, stop_distance must be at least 32.54 points.\n\nATR14 is 32.202, which is close to 32.54, so roughly 1 ATR stop.\n\nSo for ETH, I can set stop_loss at entry_price - ATR14 = 4066.95 - 32.202 = 4034.748, and use leverage=25x.\n\nThen stop_distance = 32.202\n\nr = (leverage * stop_distance) / entry_price = (25 * 32.202) / 4066.95 = 805.05 / 4066.95 ≈ 0.198, which is slightly less than 0.2? 0.198 < 0.2, so not satisfied. Need stop_distance slightly larger.\n\nSet stop_distance = 33 points, then r= (25*33)/4066.95 = 825/4066.95 ≈ 0.2028, which is大于0.2.\n\nSo stop_loss = 4066.95 - 33 = 4033.95 approximately.\n\nBut technically, ATR is 32.202, so I can use stop_distance=33.\n\nNow, for margin, with confidence 0.75, margin=20-40% of available cash. Available cash=15327.08, so say margin=30% = 4598.124 USD.\n\nLeverage=25x.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 4598.124 * 25 = 114953.1 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 114953.1 / 4066.95 ≈ 28.26 ETH.\n\nStop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 4066.95 - 33 = 4033.95\n\nRisk_usd = quantity * stop_distance = 28.26 * 33 ≈ 932.58 USD? Let's calculate: 28.26 * 33 = 28*33=924, 0.26*33=8.58, total 932.58 USD.\n\nNow, margin=4598.124, so r = risk_usd / margin = 932.58 / 4598.124 ≈ 0.2028, which is between 0.2 and 0.8, good.\n\nNow, profit_target: I need to set a profit target that captures asymmetric upside. Since I'm buying for a bounce, I can target a resistance level. Looking at intraday prices, the high was around 4115, so perhaps target 4100 or higher. But to exceed costs, I need a good move.\n\nExpected move: from 4066 to, say, 4100, is 33 points, same as stop, so 1:1 risk-reward, but with fees, I need more. Funding rate is small, fees 0.09% round-trip.\n\nEntry price 4066.95, if I target 4100, gain per coin = 33.05, while stop loss 33, so almost 1:1, but after fees, it might be marginal.\n\nI should target a higher level. For example, back to EMA20 at 4109.154, so target 4110.\n\nThen profit_distance = 4110 - 4066.95 = 43.05 points.\n\nRisk-reward ratio = 43.05 / 33 ≈ 1.3, which is better.\n\nBut is it realistic? RSI is oversold, so bounce to EMA20 is possible.\n\nI can set profit_target at 4110.\n\nBut let's make it a multiple of stop_distance. Stop_distance=33, so profit_distance should be multiple, say 1.5x or 2x. 1.5*33=49.5, so target 4066.95 + 49.5 = 4116.45, which is above EMA20.\n\nOr 2x=66, target 4132.95, which might be too high.\n\nI'll set profit_target at 4110 for now, but to be safe, make it 4115.\n\nSet profit_target = 4115.\n\nProfit_distance = 4115 - 4066.95 = 48.05 points.\n\nRisk-reward = 48.05 / 33 ≈ 1.456, which is acceptable.\n\nInvalidation_condition: for entry, I need to set an invalidation condition. Similar to existing positions, I can set if price closes below stop_loss on a 3-minute candle, but stop_loss is already there. The invalidation condition is for early exit besides stop and profit. I can set something like if the price fails to bounce and breaks below a lower level, but since I have stop_loss, invalidation might be redundant. But instructions require it. I can set invalidation if price closes below 4000 on 3-min candle, or something.\n\nTo keep it simple, I can set invalidation condition same as stop_loss: if price closes below stop_loss. But that might be the same as stop hit. Perhaps set if price closes below a key level, like 4000.\n\nSet invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nBut 4000 is below my stop_loss of 4033.95, so if price closes below 4000, it would have hit stop_loss first probably. But invalidation is for additional reason, so it's fine.\n\nNow, confidence: I said 0.75.\n\nRisk_usd calculated as 932.58 USD.\n\nBut I need to ensure that margin is at least 5% of available cash. 4598.124 / 15327.08 ≈ 0.3, which is greater than 0.05, good.\n\nNow, for the existing positions, I hold them.\n\nBut I am considering entering ETH, but I need to check if I have available cash. Available cash is 15327.08, and margin for ETH is 4598.124, which is less than available cash, so I can enter.\n\nBut I am already in five positions, and the instructions say \"no pyramiding\", but that means no adding to existing positions. For new coin, it's allowed since I'm flat.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If you see a big opportunity, size it correctly on entry, because you wont be able to scale up your position on that name.\" So for ETH, I can enter.\n\nBut I need to make sure I'm not over-leveraged overall. My current positions have notional values: SOL 6703.33, XRP 9559.34, BTC 13679.46, DOGE 5538.87, BNB 6409.01, total notional = 6703.33+9559.34=16262.67, +13679.46=29942.13, +5538.87=35481, +6409.01=41890.01 USD approximately.\n\nAccount value is 21215.12, so total notional is 41890, which is about 2x account value, so leverage is about 2x overall, which is fine.\n\nIf I add ETH notional 114953.1, total notional becomes 41890 + 114953.1 = 156843.1, account value 21215.12, leverage 156843.1 / 21215.12 ≈ 7.4x, which might be high, but since positions are diversified, it might be ok, but I need to check liquidation prices.\n\nThe liquidation prices are provided for each position, and they are far away: for example, BTC liquidation at 98146, current 113995, so safe. Similarly for others.\n\nBut adding ETH with leverage 25x, liquidation price might be close. Calculate liquidation for ETH.\n\nFor long position, liquidation price = entry_price * (1 - 1/leverage) for isolated? But in the existing positions, liquidation price is given. For example, BTC entry 107343, leverage 10, liquidation 98146, which is about 8.5% below entry.\n\nFor ETH, leverage 25x, liquidation price = entry_price * (1 - 1/leverage) = 4066.95 * (1 - 1/25) = 4066.95 * 0.96 = 3904.272, so if price drops to 3904, I get liquidated.\n\nMy stop_loss is at 4033.95, which is above liquidation, so stop should trigger before liquidation, so it's safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo overall, it should be ok.\n\nNow, for ETH entry, I need to output the JSON.\n\nBut first, I need to decide if I really want to enter. The RSI is very oversold, so it's a good opportunity.\n\nAnother thing: funding rate is positive, which is good for longs.\n\nOpen interest is stable.\n\nSo I think I'll enter ETH long.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I act on or hold.\n\nSo for existing positions: SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, I output 'hold' with their current quantity, etc.\n\nFor ETH, I output 'buy_to_enter' with the calculated parameters.\n\nBut for hold, I need to provide the same fields: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nFor existing positions, I have these from the account info.\n\nIn the account info, for each position, I have exit_plan which includes profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and also confidence, risk_usd, leverage.\n\nSo for hold, I can use those values.\n\nSimilarly, for close, I would use the same, but I'm not closing.\n\nSo for each existing position, I output the hold JSON with the values from the account.\n\nFor ETH entry, I need to create new values.\n\nNow, confirm the values for ETH.\n\nSignal: buy_to_enter\n\nCoin: ETH\n\nQuantity: from above, approximately 28.26 ETH. But I need to calculate precisely.\n\nMargin = 4598.124 USD (30% of 15327.08)\n\nLeverage = 25\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 4598.124 * 25 = 114953.1 USD\n\nEntry_price = 4066.95\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 114953.1 / 4066.95 ≈ 28.260? Let's calculate: 4066.95 * 28.26 = 4066.95 * 28 = 113874.6, 4066.95 * 0.26 = 1057.407, total 113874.6 + 1057.407 = 114931.007, close to 114953.1, difference due to rounding. Better to calculate exactly.\n\nAvailable cash = 15327.08, margin = 0.3 * 15327.08 = 4598.124\n\nLeverage=25, notional=4598.124 * 25 = 114953.1\n\nEntry_price=4066.95\n\nQuantity = 114953.1 / 4066.95 = ? Compute: 114953.1 ÷ 4066.95 ≈ 28.260 (since 4066.95 * 28.26 = as above ≈114931, off by 22.1, so better use more precision.\n\n15327.08 * 0.3 = 4598.124 exactly? 15327.08 * 0.3 = 4598.124, yes.\n\n114953.1 / 4066.95 = let's calculate: 4066.95 * 28.26 = 4066.95 * 20 = 81339, 4066.95 * 8 = 32535.6, total 81339+32535.6=113874.6, then 4066.95 * 0.26 = 1057.407, so 113874.6 + 1057.407 = 114931.007, but notional is 114953.1, so difference 114953.1 - 114931.007 = 22.093, so quantity should be 28.26 + 22.093 / 4066.95 ≈ 28.26 + 0.00543 ≈ 28.26543. So approximately 28.27 ETH? But perps allow fractional quantities, so I can use 28.27 or keep as calculated.\n\nTo avoid rounding errors, I should compute quantity directly from margin and leverage.\n\nQuantity = (margin * leverage) / entry_price = (4598.124 * 25) / 4066.95 = 114953.1 / 4066.95\n\nCompute numerically: 114953.1 ÷ 4066.95 ≈ 28.260 (using calculator, but since I don't have, I'll use 28.26 for simplicity, as the error is small.\n\nActually, in programming, it would be precise, but for this, I'll use 28.26.\n\nBut let's use exact values.\n\nSet margin = 15327.08 * 0.3 = 4598.124\n\nLeverage=25\n\nNotional=4598.124 * 25 = 114953.1\n\nEntry_price=4066.95\n\nQuantity = 114953.1 / 4066.95 = 114953.1 ÷ 4066.95\n\nCalculate: 4066.95 * 28 = 113874.6, subtract from 114953.1: 114953.1 - 113874.6 = 1078.5, so 1078.5 / 4066.95 ≈ 0.265, so quantity = 28.265 ETH. So I'll use quantity = 28.27 approximately, or exactly 28.265.\n\nIn JSON, I can use a float. So quantity = 114953.1 / 4066.95 = let's compute exactly.\n\n114953.1 / 4066.95 = 114953.1 / 4066.95 = I'll use 28.265\n\nBut to be precise, I'll calculate it as num/denom.\n\nSince entry_price is given, I can use quantity = notional / entry_price.\n\nBut in output, I need to provide quantity, so I'll compute it.\n\nPerhaps I should choose margin such that quantity is nice.\n\nAnother way: I can set quantity based on risk.\n\nBut I'll proceed with margin=4598.124, leverage=25, entry_price=4066.95, quantity = 4598.124 * 25 / 4066.95 = (4598.124 / 4066.95) * 25\n\n4598.124 / 4066.95 ≈ 1.1305, times 25 = 28.2625, so quantity ≈ 28.26 ETH.\n\nI'll use quantity = 28.26\n\nNow, stop_loss: I set at entry_price - stop_distance, with stop_distance=33, so stop_loss = 4066.95 - 33 = 4033.95\n\nBut to be exact, since stop_distance=33, stop_loss=4066.95 - 33 = 4033.95\n\nProfit_target: set at 4115, so profit_target=4115\n\nInvalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nConfidence: 0.75\n\nRisk_usd: as calculated, risk_usd = quantity * stop_distance = 28.26 * 33 = 932.58 USD\n\nLeverage: 25\n\nJustification: for ETH entry, I need a justification: \"ETH is extremely oversold with RSI7 at 13.3, indicating a high probability of a bounce. The price is below EMA20 but at a key level, and funding rate is positive. I expect a reversal towards 4115.\"\n\nNow, for existing positions, I hold them.\n\nSo for output, I need JSON for each coin: SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB with hold signal, and ETH with buy_to_enter.\n\nThe JSON should be a object for each coin.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo like { \"SOL\": { ... }, \"XRP\": { ... }, etc.}\n\nAnd for each, the trade_signal_args.\n\nFor hold, the JSON has the same fields as close, but signal is hold.\n\nIn the hold example, it has justification? Let's check the instructions.\n\nFor hold: \n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIt doesn't have justification for hold? In the example, for hold, it doesn't show justification, but for entry and close, it does.\n\nCheck the instructions:\n\nFor Entry/Exit: has \"justification\": \"<1–4 sentences>\",\n\nFor Close: has \"justification\": \"<1–2 sentences>\",\n\nFor Hold: in the example, it does not have \"justification\" key. Let's see:\n\n**If Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n\t  \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n\t  \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNo justification mentioned for hold. So for hold, I don't need to provide justification. Only for entry and close.\n\nSimilarly, for close, justification is 1-2 sentences, for entry, 1-4 sentences.\n\nSo for hold, I omit justification.\n\nNow, for the existing positions, I have the values from account info.\n\nFor example, for SOL:\n- quantity: 33.88\n- profit_target: 215.0\n- stop_loss: 192.86\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 202.07655\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to use the exact values from the account.\n\nIn the account info, for each position, I have exit_plan which has profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and separately confidence, risk_usd, leverage.\n\nSo for hold, I use those.\n\nSimilarly for XRP, BTC, etc.\n\nNow, for ETH entry, I have my calculated values.\n\nSo I'll proceed.\n\nFinal decision: hold all existing positions, and enter ETH long.\n\nNow, output JSON.\n\nFirst, for ETH:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"justification\": \"ETH is extremely oversold with RSI7 at 13.3, indicating a high probability of a bounce. The price is below EMA20 but at a key level, and funding rate is positive. I expect a reversal towards 4115.\",\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"buy_to_enter\",\n      \"quantity\": 28.26,\n      \"profit_target\": 4115.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 4033.95,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 932.58\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nBut quantity should be precise. I calculated quantity = 28.26, but let's use the exact calculation.\n\nmargin = 15327.08 * 0.3 = 4598.124\n\nnotional = 4598.124 * 25 = 114953.1\n\nentry_price = 4066.95\n\nquantity = 114953.1 / 4066.95 ≈ 28.2625, so I'll use 28.26 or 28.263? In JSON, I can use float, so 28.26 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, stop_loss = 4066.95 - 33 = 4033.95, but 33 is approximate, I used stop_distance=33 for calculation, but earlier I said stop_distance=33 exactly.\n\nI set stop_distance=33 to satisfy r>=0.2, so stop_loss=4066.95 - 33 = 4033.95\n\nBut 4066.95 - 33 = 4033.95, yes.\n\nprofit_target=4115\n\nrisk_usd = quantity * stop_distance = 28.26 * 33 = 932.58, but with quantity=28.26, it's approximate.\n\nTo be precise, use quantity = notional / entry_price = 114953.1 / 4066.95\n\nCompute exactly: 114953.1 / 4066.95 = 28.2625, so quantity=28.2625\n\nThen risk_usd = 28.2625 * 33 = 932.6625 USD\n\nSo I'll use quantity=28.26, risk_usd=932.66 approximately.\n\nBut in JSON, I can use decimals.\n\nNow for hold positions.\n\nFor SOL:\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 33.88,\n      \"profit_target\": 215.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 192.86,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 202.07655\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to do for all coins I have positions in, and ETH for entry.\n\nThe coins I have positions are SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, and I'm adding ETH.\n\nSo six coins in total for output.\n\nBut the output should be a single JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo I'll combine them.\n\nNow, write the JSON.",

Otherwise, I should hold.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n1. **ETH**: \n   - Current price: 4057.35, entry price: 4056.19, so it's slightly up.\n   - Unrealized PnL: +32.75\n   - Exit plan: profit target 4115.0, stop loss 4033.95, invalidation: price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above stop loss and invalidation level. No invalidation triggered. RSI is very low at 11.035, which might indicate oversold, but since I'm long, low RSI could be good for a bounce. EMA20 is at 4104.148, above current price, but price is below EMA, which might suggest weakness. However, invalidation not hit. So, I should hold.\n\n2. **SOL**:\n   - Current price: 197.605, entry price: 198.82, so down.\n   - Unrealized PnL: -41.16\n   - Exit plan: profit target 215.0, stop loss 192.86, invalidation: price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above stop loss and invalidation. RSI at 15.925, very oversold. EMA20 at 199.325, above current price. Invalidation not triggered. Hold.\n\n3. **XRP**:\n   - Current price: 2.6428, entry price: 2.44, so up significantly.\n   - Unrealized PnL: +714.58\n   - Exit plan: profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325, invalidation: price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is well above stop loss and invalidation. RSI at 18.097, oversold, but since it's up, might be okay. EMA20 at 2.663, close to current price. Invalidation not hit. Hold.\n\n4. **BTC**:\n   - Current price: 113853.5, entry price: 107343.0, so up a lot.\n   - Unrealized PnL: +781.26\n   - Exit plan: profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation: price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is way above stop loss and invalidation. RSI at 12.087, extremely oversold. EMA20 at 114727.814, above current price, but price is below EMA. Invalidation not triggered. Hold.\n\n5. **DOGE**:\n   - Current price: 0.198345, entry price: 0.18, so up.\n   - Unrealized PnL: +383.63\n   - Exit plan: profit target 0.212275, stop loss 0.175355, invalidation: price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above stop loss and invalidation. RSI at 8.776, very oversold. EMA20 at 0.2, above current price. Invalidation not hit. Hold.\n\n6. **BNB**:\n   - Current price: 1134.85, entry price: 1140.6, so down slightly.\n   - Unrealized PnL: -32.43\n   - Exit plan: profit target 1254.29, stop loss 1083.23, invalidation: price closes below 1080 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above stop loss and invalidation. RSI at 16.412, oversold. EMA20 at 1141.338, above current price. Invalidation not hit. Hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered. For all positions, I should hold.\n\nNow, for new entries: I am currently holding positions in all six coins, so I cannot enter new positions in these coins because I already have positions. The instructions say: \"If a position is open in a coin, the only allowed signals are 'hold' or 'close_position'.\" So, for all coins I have positions in, I must only consider hold or close. Since no invalidation, I hold.\n\nI am not considering new entries in other coins because all tradable coins are already in my positions. The tradable tokens are ['ETH','SOL','XRP','BTC','DOGE','BNB'], and I have positions in all of them. So, no new entries possible.\n\nTherefore, for this invocation, I should output hold signals for all six coins.\n\nFor the JSON output, for each coin, I need to provide the trade_signal_args with signal: 'hold', and include all the required fields: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI have the current quantities from the account information. I need to use the full current size for quantity.\n\nI also need to provide the same profit_target, stop_loss, and invalidation_condition from the exit plan, as I'm not changing them. The instructions say for hold, I should supply the current values.\n\nLeverage, confidence, risk_usd are also from the current positions.\n\nSo, for each coin, I'll output the hold signal with the existing parameters.\n\nThe JSON structure for hold is as per the example.\n\nI must output one JSON object per coin, but the overall output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nThe example shows:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      ... \n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSo, for multiple coins, I need to have a JSON object with keys for each coin symbol.\n\nFinally, I need to ensure no prose, only JSON.\n\nSo, let's compile the data for each coin.\n\nFrom account info:\n\nETH: quantity=28.23, profit_target=4115.0, stop_loss=4033.95, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=25, confidence=0.75, risk_usd=932.58\n\nSOL: quantity=33.88, profit_target=215.0, stop_loss=192.86, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=202.07655\n\nXRP: quantity=3609.0, profit_target=2.815, stop_loss=2.325, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=442.032\n\nBTC: quantity=0.12, profit_target=118136.15, stop_loss=102026.675, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.75, risk_usd=619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity=27858.0, profit_target=0.212275, stop_loss=0.175355, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=257.13\n\nBNB: quantity=5.64, profit_target=1254.29, stop_loss=1083.23, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 1080 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=321.61725\n\nI need to make sure the invalidation_condition is a string, as per the example.\n\nAlso, for hold, there is no justification needed in the trade_signal_args, according to the example. The example for hold does not have a \"justification\" key, while for entry and close, it does. So for hold, I should omit justification.\n\nLooking back at the instructions:\n\nFor hold: \n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification mentioned. Similarly, for close, justification is required, but for hold, it's not in the example. The instructions say: \"For Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position\" and the example doesn't have justification. Whereas for entry and close, it does.\n\nSo, for hold, I should not include justification.\n\nSimilarly, for close, I need justification, but I'm not closing any.\n\nSo, for all, I'll output hold without justification.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to have a single JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, the output should be:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"SOL\": { ... },\n  \"XRP\": { ... },\n  \"BTC\": { ... },\n  \"DOGE\": { ... },\n  \"BNB\": { ... }\n}\n\nEach with the trade_signal_args.\n\nI think that's it.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "My analysis shows that despite some positions being slightly down, all invalidation conditions are currently unmet, so I'm holding all my positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. I’m feeling confident in this strategy, as the market has been showing oversold conditions across the board, suggesting potential for reversals."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. For each, I must decide whether to hold or close based on the invalidation condition or other factors.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n1. **SOL**: \n   - Current price: 195.33, entry: 198.82, unrealized PnL: -118.24\n   - Exit plan: profit target 215.0, stop loss 192.86, invalidation: price closes below 190 on 3-min candle.\n   - Current price is above stop loss (192.86) and not below invalidation (190). RSI is low at 15.256, but I should hold unless invalidation triggers.\n\n2. **XRP**:\n   - Current price: 2.61655, entry: 2.44, unrealized PnL: +619.85\n   - Exit plan: profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325, invalidation: price closes below 2.30.\n   - Price is above stop loss and invalidation. RSI is 17.223, still low. Hold.\n\n3. **BTC**:\n   - Current price: 113662.5, entry: 107343.0, unrealized PnL: +758.34\n   - Exit plan: profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation: price closes below 105000.\n   - Price is well above stop loss and invalidation. RSI is 25.342, oversold but holding. Hold.\n\n4. **DOGE**:\n   - Current price: 0.196615, entry: 0.18, unrealized PnL: +335.44\n   - Exit plan: profit target 0.212275, stop loss 0.175355, invalidation: price closes below 0.180.\n   - Price is above stop loss and invalidation. RSI 20.702. Hold.\n\n5. **BNB**:\n   - Current price: 1127.05, entry: 1140.6, unrealized PnL: -76.42\n   - Exit plan: profit target 1254.29, stop loss 1083.23, invalidation: price closes below 1080.\n   - Current price is above stop loss (1083.23) and not below invalidation (1080). RSI 17.948. Hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered. For all positions, I should hold.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new trades. I'm already in 5 positions, which might be a lot, but the instructions don't limit the number of positions, only that I should avoid over-trading. I have available cash of 14638.14, which is about 73% of account value (20081.13), so I have room, but I should be cautious.\n\nI should look for alpha opportunities. The market data shows many coins are oversold with low RSI. For example, BTC RSI 25.342, ETH 17.555, SOL 15.256, BNB 17.948, XRP 17.223, DOGE 20.702. All are below 30, indicating potential oversold conditions. However, I'm already long in most, except ETH which I don't have a position in.\n\nETH: I don't have a position. Current price 4035.6, EMA20 4074.945, so price below EMA. RSI very low at 17.555, MACD negative but might be bottoming. Funding rate is low positive. Open interest decreasing slightly. Volume is low compared to average, which might indicate lack of selling pressure.\n\nI could consider a long entry on ETH. But I need to ensure the expected move exceeds trading costs.\n\nFirst, calculate trading costs: round-trip fees 0.09%, plus slippage and funding. Funding is 1.25e-05, which is negligible. Slippage might be small for ETH. So total costs around 0.1% or so. I need a move that covers that.\n\nFor a long entry, I need to set margin, leverage, risk_usd, profit target, stop loss.\n\nConfidence: Since RSI is very oversold, and price below EMA, but EMA might act as resistance. However, oversold bounce could happen. Confidence might be moderate. Say 0.70? Looking at confidence table: 0.70-0.85 suggests margin 20-40% of available cash.\n\nAvailable cash: 14638.14. 20% is about 2927.63, 40% is 5855.26. I should choose a margin. Since I have other positions, I might not want to go too high. Maybe 25% of available cash? That's about 3659.535.\n\nBut I need to ensure margin is at least 5% of available cash, which is 731.907, so 3659 is fine.\n\nLeverage: For ETH, max leverage is 25x. I should use at least 5x. Since confidence is not extremely high, maybe use 10x leverage, similar to other positions.\n\nRisk_usd: Should be a fraction of margin, between 0.2 and 0.8. Say I set risk_usd = 0.5 * margin. If margin is 3659.535, risk_usd = 1829.7675.\n\nBut I need to calculate stop distance based on that.\n\nEntry price: current_price = 4035.6\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price. Notional = margin * leverage.\n\nIf leverage=10, notional = 3659.535 * 10 = 36595.35 USD\n\nQuantity = 36595.35 / 4035.6 ≈ 9.07 ETH? Let me calculate properly.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = (margin * leverage) / entry_price\n\nBut in the output, for entry, I need to specify quantity, which is positive, and signal direction is separate.\n\nIn the JSON, for buy_to_enter, quantity is the number of contracts, which for perps, it's the amount, so for ETH, it might be in ETH units.\n\nYes, from existing positions, for BTC quantity is 0.12, which is BTC amount, so similarly for ETH, quantity should be in ETH.\n\nSo for ETH, if I go long, quantity = notional / entry_price.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage.\n\nFirst, set margin. I need to decide confidence.\n\nLooking at ETH data: RSI 7-period is 17.555, which is extremely oversold. Historically, such low RSI often leads to bounces. MACD is negative but not worsening drastically. Price is below EMA20, but the EMA is declining slowly. The 4-hour EMA20 is 4077.257 vs price 4035.6, so still below, but ATR is 32.202, so stop loss should be based on volatility.\n\nI should set stop loss at a level where if broken, the thesis is invalidated. For a long, I might set stop below recent lows.\n\nLooking at intraday prices: [4059.1, 4058.65, 4051.95, 4064.95, 4071.95, 4064.05, 4057.85, 4057.45, 4049.75, 4035.6]. The lowest is 4035.6, but it's the current, so recent low might be around 4035.6. I need to set stop loss below that.\n\nATR 14-period is 32.202, so a stop distance of say 1 ATR might be too wide, but for risk management.\n\nI need to set risk_usd first.\n\nPerhaps I can base stop loss on a technical level. Since RSI is low, I might set stop at a point where if price falls further, the oversold condition might worsen.\n\nBut let's calculate based on risk.\n\nI need profit target to be a multiple of stop distance to cover costs.\n\nTrading costs: roughly 0.1%. For the trade to be profitable, the move should be at least 0.1% plus the risk reward ratio.\n\nTypically, I want a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2 or better.\n\nSo, if stop distance is S, profit target distance should be at least 2S or more.\n\nNow, for ETH, let's estimate volatility.\n\nATR 14-period on 4-hour is 32.202, but since we're trading perps, intraday volatility might be lower. The intraday series shows prices ranging from 4035.6 to 4071.95 over 10 periods (30 minutes), so max range about 36 points, but current is low.\n\nPerhaps use the 3-period ATR on 4-hour is 20.038, which might be for 4-hour candles, but for 3-minute intervals, I should look at the data.\n\nThe intraday series is 3-minute intervals, but no ATR given for intraday. Only 4-hour ATR is provided.\n\nI can calculate the range from intraday prices. The last 10 prices: min 4035.6, max 4071.95, so range 36.35. Average true range might be less.\n\nPerhaps use the 14-period ATR from 4-hour, but that's for longer term. For short-term stop, I might use a fraction of ATR.\n\nTo simplify, I can set stop loss at a percentage below entry.\n\nBut I need to calculate stop_distance from risk_usd.\n\nRecall: for long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance, and stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity.\n\nBut quantity depends on margin and leverage.\n\nI need to decide margin, leverage, risk_usd simultaneously.\n\nSet confidence first. I think for ETH, with oversold RSI, confidence might be around 0.75. Because RSI is very low, and bounce is likely, but not certain. So confidence 0.75, which suggests margin 20-40% of available cash. I'll choose 30% for margin.\n\nAvailable cash: 14638.14\n\n30% of available cash: 0.3 * 14638.14 = 4391.442 USD as margin.\n\nLeverage: for ETH, max 25x, I'll use 10x, as I have for other positions.\n\nSo notional = margin * leverage = 4391.442 * 10 = 43914.42 USD\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 43914.42 / 4035.6 ≈ 10.88 ETH (let's calculate exactly: 43914.42 / 4035.6 = 10.880, so about 10.88)\n\nNow, risk_usd: I need risk_usd = r * margin, with r between 0.2 and 0.8. Say r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 4391.442 = 2195.721 USD\n\nThen stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 2195.721 / 10.88 ≈ 201.81 USD per ETH? stop_distance should be in price units.\n\nrisk_usd is the total dollar risk, so for the position, risk_usd = quantity * (entry_price - stop_loss) for long.\n\nSo stop_distance = (entry_price - stop_loss) = risk_usd / quantity\n\nSo stop_distance = 2195.721 / 10.88 ≈ 201.81? That seems large because entry price is 4035.6, so stop_loss would be 4035.6 - 201.81 = 3833.79, which is a drop of about 5%. But ATR is 32, so 201 is too big; ATR 32 is about 0.8% of price, so 5% is too wide.\n\nI need a smaller risk_usd or larger quantity, but quantity is fixed by margin and leverage.\n\nPerhaps I need to adjust risk_usd or use higher leverage to reduce stop_distance.\n\nstop_distance = risk_usd / quantity\n\nBut quantity = notional / entry_price = (margin * leverage) / entry_price\n\nSo stop_distance = risk_usd / [ (margin * leverage) / entry_price ] = (risk_usd * entry_price) / (margin * leverage)\n\nSince risk_usd = r * margin, so stop_distance = (r * margin * entry_price) / (margin * leverage) = (r * entry_price) / leverage\n\nSo stop_distance is proportional to entry_price and r, inversely to leverage.\n\nFor example, if leverage=10, r=0.5, entry_price=4035.6, stop_distance = (0.5 * 4035.6) / 10 = 2017.8 / 10 = 201.78, same as before.\n\nBut this stop_distance is too large; it's 201.78 / 4035.6 ≈ 5% drop.\n\nI want a tighter stop. To reduce stop_distance, I can increase leverage or decrease r.\n\nLeverage max is 25 for ETH, so if I use leverage=25, stop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage = (0.5 * 4035.6) / 25 = 2017.8 / 25 = 80.712, which is about 2% drop.\n\nOr I can decrease r. If r=0.2, stop_distance = (0.2 * 4035.6) / 10 = 807.12 / 10 = 80.712, same as with leverage=25 and r=0.5.\n\nstop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage\n\nSo for fixed entry_price, stop_distance is determined by r and leverage.\n\nI need stop_distance to be reasonable based on volatility.\n\nATR 14-period on 4-hour is 32.202, which is about 0.8% of 4035.6. For intraday, a stop might be set at 1 ATR or less. Say I want stop_distance around 40 points (about 1% of price).\n\nSo stop_distance ≈ 40.\n\nThen from stop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage, so 40 = (r * 4035.6) / leverage\n\nIf I use leverage=10, then 40 = (r * 4035.6) / 10, so r * 4035.6 = 400, r = 400 / 4035.6 ≈ 0.099, which is less than 0.2, not allowed since r must be at least 0.2.\n\nr must be between 0.2 and 0.8.\n\nSo with leverage=10, minimum stop_distance when r=0.2 is (0.2 * 4035.6) / 10 = 807.12 / 10 = 80.712, which is about 2%, still large.\n\nIf I use higher leverage, say leverage=25, then with r=0.2, stop_distance = (0.2 * 4035.6) / 25 = 807.12 / 25 = 32.2848, which is about 0.8%, close to ATR of 32.2, so reasonable.\n\nSo for ETH, I should use higher leverage to have a tighter stop.\n\nMax leverage for ETH is 25x, so I can use leverage=25.\n\nThen with r=0.2, stop_distance ≈ 32.28, which is good.\n\nNow, margin: with confidence 0.75, I'll set margin to 30% of available cash, so margin = 0.3 * 14638.14 = 4391.442 USD\n\nThen risk_usd = r * margin = 0.2 * 4391.442 = 878.2884 USD\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 4391.442 * 25 = 109786.05 USD\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 109786.05 / 4035.6 ≈ 27.20 ETH\n\nStop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 4035.6 - 32.2848 ≈ 4003.3152\n\nI need to set profit target. Profit target should be a multiple of stop_distance. Say 2 times, so profit distance = 2 * 32.2848 ≈ 64.5696, so profit_target = entry_price + profit_distance = 4035.6 + 64.5696 ≈ 4100.1696\n\nBut to cover costs, and for good reward, maybe 3 times? Since trading costs are small, 2 times might be ok, but I want asymmetric upside. With oversold bounce, price could move to EMA20 at 4074.945, which is about 39 points above, while stop distance is 32, so profit distance 39 is about 1.2 times stop distance, which is less than 2.\n\nI need profit target to be at least such that reward-risk ratio is good. Typically, aim for 2:1 or better.\n\nCurrent price to EMA20 is about 4074.945 - 4035.6 = 39.345, which is slightly more than stop distance of 32.28, so ratio about 1.22, which is less than 2.\n\nBut EMA20 might be resistance, so profit target might be set at EMA20 or above.\n\nI can set profit target at a level where RSI recovers, say above 50, but I need a specific price.\n\nPerhaps use a multiple. Since stop distance is 32.28, set profit distance to 3 times, so 96.84, profit target 4035.6 + 96.84 = 4132.44, which is above EMA20.\n\nBut is it realistic? The 4-hour EMA50 is 4016.076, so above that. Recent high was 4071.95, so 4132 is higher.\n\nI should look at longer-term levels.\n\nPerhaps I can set profit target based on previous resistance or something.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll set profit target at 2.5 times stop distance, so profit distance = 2.5 * 32.28 = 80.7, profit target = 4035.6 + 80.7 = 4116.3\n\nNow, invalidation condition: for a long, if the price closes below a key level, say below the recent low of 4035.6, but that's entry, so stop loss is already below. Invalidation should be something else, like if RSI fails to bounce or something, but it needs to be quantifiable.\n\nThe instruction says: \"invalidation_condition: a measurable quantity that acts as the only reason to exit a position, outside of the stop being hit.\"\n\nSo for example, if price breaks below a support level on higher timeframe.\n\nI can set invalidation if the price closes below the 4-hour EMA50 or something.\n\n4-hour EMA50 is 4016.076, which is below my stop loss of 4003.315, so stop loss is below EMA50, so if price closes below EMA50, it might already hit stop loss.\n\nI need invalidation to be a condition that would make me exit even if stop not hit, like if the thesis is wrong.\n\nFor oversold bounce thesis, if RSI remains low or price consolidates without bouncing, but I need a specific trigger.\n\nPerhaps if the price fails to reach a certain level within a time frame, but that's not measurable in this setup since I'm invoked every 3 minutes.\n\nI think for simplicity, I can set invalidation condition as \"If the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle\" or something, but that's close to stop loss.\n\nTo avoid duplication, I should set invalidation to something rare, like a break of a major level.\n\nSince I'm using technicals, I can set invalidation if the 4-hour EMA20 crosses below EMA50 or something, but that might take time.\n\nPerhaps for now, I'll set invalidation as \"If the price closes below 3950 on a 3-minute candle\" which is below my stop loss, so it might not trigger before stop.\n\nBut invalidation should be the only reason to exit outside stop, so it should be a condition that invalidates the thesis before stop is hit.\n\nFor example, if there's a sudden news event, but I can't quantify that.\n\nI think a common approach is to set invalidation based on a longer-term moving average or volatility break.\n\nI'll set invalidation for ETH long as \"If the price closes below the 4-hour EMA50 (4016.076) on a 4-hour candle\" but since I'm on 3-minute, I need to use 3-minute closes.\n\nThe data is provided, but I don't have real-time access to 4-hour closes. In the input, I have the current 4-hour EMA values, but for closes, I need the candle close.\n\nPerhaps I can use the current price relative to EMA. But \"closes below\" implies on a candle close.\n\nTo make it simple, I'll set invalidation as \"If the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle\" since 4000 is a psychological level and below EMA50.\n\nBut my stop loss is at 4003.315, so if price closes below 4000, it might have already hit stop loss if it drops fast.\n\nI need to set invalidation above stop loss or at a different condition.\n\nPerhaps for oversold bounce, if RSI remains below 20 for consecutive periods, but I need to define.\n\nI think for now, I'll set invalidation as \"If the RSI (7-period) remains below 15 for 3 consecutive 3-minute periods\" or something, but that might be too complex.\n\nLooking at existing positions, they have invalidation like \"price closes below X on 3-minute candle\".\n\nSo I'll do similar. For ETH, I'll set invalidation as \"If the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle\" but since stop loss is at 4003, it might be redundant.\n\nTo avoid early exit, I should set invalidation at a level that would indicate the bounce is failing, say if price breaks below a recent support.\n\nThe recent low in intraday is 4035.6, but it's current, so perhaps below 4030 or something.\n\nI'll set invalidation as \"If the price closes below 4020 on a 3-minute candle\" which is above my stop loss of 4003, so if price closes below 4020, I exit before stop is hit, if it's a slow move.\n\nBut that might make me exit early. I need to think.\n\nPerhaps for ETH, with low RSI, the thesis is that it will bounce, so if it breaks below a key level, it might not bounce. But I have stop loss for risk management.\n\nI think I'll set invalidation similarly to others: \"If the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle\" but adjust stop loss or something.\n\nAnother idea: set invalidation based on MACD or other indicator.\n\nTo save time, I'll set invalidation for ETH as \"If the MACD histogram turns positive while price is below EMA20\" or something, but that's not a close condition.\n\nI think I'll keep it simple and use price level. Since EMA20 is 4074.945, and price is below, invalidation could be if price fails to break above EMA20 within a certain time, but again, not measurable.\n\nI'll set invalidation as \"If the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle\" and accept that it might be close to stop.\n\nBut in practice, for this exercise, it should be fine.\n\nNow, confidence: I said 0.75.\n\nBut let's confirm if I should enter ETH. I am already in 5 positions, and ETH is oversold, but I might be over-diversified. However, the instructions don't limit number of positions, so I can enter if I see alpha.\n\nOther coins: I am already long in SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. ETH is the only one I'm not in, and it's also oversold.\n\nPerhaps I should enter ETH long.\n\nBut let's check if there are better opportunities. All are oversold, so maybe I should hold existing positions and not add new ones to avoid over-trading.\n\nThe instruction says \"avoid over-trading by discovering alpha\", so if I don't see strong alpha, I should not trade.\n\nFor ETH, RSI is very low, so alpha might be there, but I need to see if it's better than others.\n\nPerhaps I should not enter new trades since I have multiple positions already.\n\nBut the available cash is there, and I can use it.\n\nI think I'll proceed with ETH long.\n\nSo for ETH, signal: buy_to_enter\n\nMargin: 30% of available cash = 0.3 * 14638.14 = 4391.442 USD\n\nLeverage: 25x (max for ETH)\n\nRisk_usd: with r=0.2, risk_usd = 0.2 * 4391.442 = 878.2884 USD\n\nQuantity: notional / entry_price = (4391.442 * 25) / 4035.6 = 109786.05 / 4035.6 ≈ 27.20 ETH (I'll calculate exactly later for output)\n\nStop_loss: entry_price - stop_distance, stop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage = (0.2 * 4035.6) / 25 = 807.12 / 25 = 32.2848, so stop_loss = 4035.6 - 32.2848 = 4003.3152 ≈ 4003.32\n\nProfit_target: I'll set profit distance to 2.5 times stop_distance = 2.5 * 32.2848 = 80.712, so profit_target = 4035.6 + 80.712 = 4116.312 ≈ 4116.31\n\nInvalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nConfidence: 0.75\n\nNow, for existing positions, I need to output hold for each.\n\nSo for each coin I have a position, output hold with the current quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, etc., from the exit_plan in the account info.\n\nIn the hold JSON, I need to include all fields: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nFrom the account info, for each position, I have those values.\n\nFor example, for SOL: quantity=33.88, profit_target=215.0, stop_loss=192.86, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=202.07655\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to output for each coin I act on, which for hold, it's each existing position.\n\nAlso, for ETH, I'm entering, so output for ETH.\n\nBut I am not acting on other coins like I don't have positions in, so I don't need to output for them unless I enter.\n\nThe instruction says: \"For each coin you act on during this invocation (or hold an existing position in), provide below.\"\n\nSo for coins where I have existing positions, I must output a JSON for each, with signal 'hold'.\n\nFor coins I enter new trade, output with entry signal.\n\nFor coins I don't have position and not entering, no output.\n\nSo in this case, for SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, I output hold.\n\nFor ETH, I output buy_to_enter.\n\nI am not closing any positions.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to create a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo the top-level JSON should have keys like \"SOL\", \"XRP\", etc., each containing the trade_signal_args.\n\nSo I need to create a dictionary for each.\n\nFirst, list the coins I need to output: SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB for hold, and ETH for buy_to_enter.\n\nNow, for hold signals, the JSON is:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": current_quantity,\n      \"profit_target\": from exit_plan,\n      \"stop_loss\": from exit_plan,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": from exit_plan,\n      \"leverage\": from account,\n      \"confidence\": from account,\n      \"risk_usd\": from account\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSimilarly for entry.\n\nIn the account info, for each position, I have exit_plan which has profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and separately confidence, risk_usd, leverage.\n\nSo I can use those values.\n\nFor example, for SOL:\n\ncoin: \"SOL\", signal: \"hold\", quantity: 33.88, profit_target: 215.0, stop_loss: 192.86, invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage: 10, confidence: 0.65, risk_usd: 202.07655\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor XRP: quantity=3609.0, profit_target=2.815, stop_loss=2.325, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=442.032\n\nBTC: quantity=0.12, profit_target=118136.15, stop_loss=102026.675, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.75, risk_usd=619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity=27858.0, profit_target=0.212275, stop_loss=0.175355, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=257.13\n\nBNB: quantity=5.64, profit_target=1254.29, stop_loss=1083.23, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 1080 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=321.61725\n\nFor ETH entry, I need to calculate the quantity exactly.\n\nEntry price for ETH: 4035.6\n\nMargin: 4391.442 USD\n\nLeverage: 25\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 4391.442 * 25 = 109786.05 USD\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 109786.05 / 4035.6 = let's calculate: 4035.6 * 27 = 108961.2, difference 109786.05 - 108961.2 = 824.85, so 27 + 824.85 / 4035.6 ≈ 27 + 0.2043 = 27.2043, so approximately 27.20 ETH. I'll use 27.20 for quantity, but in JSON, it should be float.\n\nActually, I should use precise calculation.\n\n109786.05 / 4035.6 = ? Let me compute: 4035.6 * 27.2 = 4035.6 * 27 = 108961.2, 4035.6 * 0.2 = 807.12, total 108961.2 + 807.12 = 109768.32, which is less than 109786.05, difference 17.73, so 27.2 + 17.73 / 4035.6 ≈ 27.2 + 0.00439 = 27.20439, so quantity = 27.2044 approximately.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll use 27.20, but in code, it might be better to use exact.\n\nSince notional is derived from margin and leverage, and entry_price is given, quantity should be exact.\n\nmargin = 4391.442, leverage=25, notional=4391.442 * 25 = 109786.05\n\nentry_price=4035.6\n\nquantity = 109786.05 / 4035.6 = let's calculate exactly: 109786.05 ÷ 4035.6\n\nFirst, 4035.6 * 27 = 108961.2\n\n109786.05 - 108961.2 = 824.85\n\n824.85 / 4035.6 ≈ 0.20436, so quantity = 27.20436 ETH\n\nI'll use 27.2044 for output, but JSON can handle float.\n\nSimilarly, stop_loss = 4035.6 - 32.2848 = 4003.3152, so 4003.32\n\nprofit_target = 4035.6 + 80.712 = 4116.312, so 4116.31\n\nrisk_usd = 878.2884\n\nconfidence=0.75\n\ninvalidation_condition=\"If the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nJustification for ETH: I need to write 1-4 sentences for entry.\n\nJustification: \"ETH is extremely oversold with RSI at 17.555, indicating a high probability of a bounce.

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. All of them are currently open, and I need to decide whether to hold or close each one based on the current market data and my invalidation conditions.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n1. **ETH**: \n   - Quantity: 27.28, Entry Price: 4040.5, Current Price: 4042.35, Unrealized PnL: +50.47\n   - Exit Plan: Profit Target: 4116.31, Stop Loss: 4003.32, Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above entry, but not near profit target. RSI is low at 30.643, which might indicate oversold, but I'm long. EMA20 is 4071.886, above current price, suggesting potential resistance. MACD is negative. Funding rate is positive but small. Open interest is slightly down from average.\n   - Invalidation condition not triggered. Price is above stop loss. I should hold.\n\n2. **SOL**:\n   - Quantity: 33.88, Entry Price: 198.82, Current Price: 195.445, Unrealized PnL: -114.35\n   - Exit Plan: Profit Target: 215.0, Stop Loss: 192.86, Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is below entry, and close to stop loss (192.86). RSI is very low at 18.402, oversold. EMA20 is 197.576, above current price. MACD negative. Funding positive. Open interest down.\n   - Price is above stop loss, but invalidation is below 190, not triggered. However, it's losing, and RSI oversold might mean bounce, but I need to stick to plan. Hold unless invalidation hits.\n\n3. **XRP**:\n   - Quantity: 3609.0, Entry Price: 2.44, Current Price: 2.62415, Unrealized PnL: +647.27\n   - Exit Plan: Profit Target: 2.815, Stop Loss: 2.325, Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Price is well above entry and stop loss. RSI is 33.449, not extreme. EMA20 is 2.641, close to current price. MACD negative but small. Funding positive. Open interest stable.\n   - Invalidation not triggered. Price is far from stop loss and profit target. Hold.\n\n4. **BTC**:\n   - Quantity: 0.12, Entry Price: 107343.0, Current Price: 113784.5, Unrealized PnL: +772.98\n   - Exit Plan: Profit Target: 118136.15, Stop Loss: 102026.675, Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Price is significantly above entry. RSI is 35.33, oversold territory but for a long position, it might be good. EMA20 is 114193.973, above current price, so resistance. MACD negative. Funding positive. Open interest stable.\n   - Invalidation not triggered. Stop loss is far below. Hold.\n\n5. **DOGE**:\n   - Quantity: 27858.0, Entry Price: 0.18, Current Price: 0.197055, Unrealized PnL: +347.7\n   - Exit Plan: Profit Target: 0.212275, Stop Loss: 0.175355, Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Price above entry. RSI is 32.224, not extreme. EMA20 is 0.199, close to current price. MACD negative. Funding slightly negative. Open interest stable.\n   - Invalidation not triggered. Hold.\n\n6. **BNB**:\n   - Quantity: 5.64, Entry Price: 1140.6, Current Price: 1128.35, Unrealized PnL: -69.09\n   - Exit Plan: Profit Target: 1254.29, Stop Loss: 1083.23, Invalidation Condition: If price closes below 1080 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Price below entry. RSI is 31.69, oversold. EMA20 is 1134.851, above current price. MACD negative. Funding slightly negative. Open interest stable.\n   - Price is above stop loss and invalidation condition (1080). Hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered, and all positions are within their stop losses. So for all existing positions, I should signal 'hold'.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new trades. I have available cash of 10218.67. But I'm already in multiple positions, and the instructions say to avoid over-trading. Also, I should only enter if I expect a move to exceed trading costs significantly.\n\nLooking at the market data:\n\n- BTC: Price below EMA20, RSI oversold, MACD negative. Might be a buying opportunity, but I'm already long BTC.\n\n- ETH: Similar, price below EMA20, RSI low.\n\n- SOL: Very oversold, RSI 18.4, but I'm already long and losing.\n\n- BNB: Oversold.\n\n- XRP: Not extreme.\n\n- DOGE: Not extreme.\n\nSince I'm already in all coins, and none are screaming for a new entry, I should probably not enter any new trades. The instructions say: \"For any coin you manage or want to enter\", but I'm managing all, so I need to output for each coin I have a position in.\n\nAlso, for 'hold', I need to output the JSON with the current full quantity, profit target, stop loss, etc., as per the exit plan.\n\nFor each coin, I need to provide the trade_signal_args with signal 'hold', and include all the details.\n\nIn the output, I must have one JSON object per coin that I act on or hold. Since I'm holding all, I need to output for ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB.\n\nNow, for the JSON structure for 'hold':\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,\n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI need to use the values from the current positions. The confidence and risk_usd are from the entry, but I should keep them consistent.\n\nFrom the account info, for each position, I have the confidence and risk_usd.\n\nFor example, for ETH: confidence 0.75, risk_usd 878.2884\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI should not change these for hold signals; just use the existing values.\n\nAlso, profit_target and stop_loss are from the exit_plan.\n\nInvalidation_condition is also from exit_plan.\n\nLeverage is from the position.\n\nQuantity is the current quantity.\n\nSo for each coin, I'll output the hold signal with these values.\n\nI don't need to calculate anything new for hold.\n\nNow, is there any coin where I should close? Looking at invalidation conditions, none are met. For example, SOL is close to stop loss but not hit, and invalidation is below 190, current price is 195.445, so not triggered.\n\nSimilarly, others are fine.\n\nSo, I'll hold all positions.\n\nFinally, output the JSON for each coin.\n\nThe output should be a single JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, something like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"SOL\": { ... },\n  ...\n}\n\nI need to make sure the JSON is valid.\n\nAlso, for justification, in hold, there's no justification field in the JSON example for hold. Looking back:\n\nFor hold:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,\n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNo justification mentioned for hold. But for close and enter, there is justification.\n\nIn the instructions, for hold, it says: \"Supply a json object for each existing position\" and the example doesn't have justification.\n\nSimilarly, in the account info, for hold, I think I don't need to add justification.\n\nBut let's read carefully:\n\n\"For Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position\"\n\nAnd the JSON example doesn't include justification.\n\nWhereas for entry and close, it does include justification.\n\nSo for hold, no justification needed.\n\nOkay, so I'll output without justification for hold.\n\nNow, for each coin, I have the values.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\nETH:\n- coin: \"ETH\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 27.28\n- profit_target: 4116.31\n- stop_loss: 4003.32\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 4000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 25\n- confidence: 0.75\n- risk_usd: 878.2884\n\nSOL:\n- coin: \"SOL\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 33.88\n- profit_target: 215.0\n- stop_loss: 192.86\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 202.07655\n\nXRP:\n- coin: \"XRP\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 3609.0\n- profit_target: 2.815\n- stop_loss: 2.325\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 442.032\n\nBTC:\n- coin: \"BTC\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 0.12\n- profit_target: 118136.15\n- stop_loss: 102026.675\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.75\n- risk_usd: 619.2345\n\nDOGE:\n- coin: \"DOGE\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 27858.0\n- profit_target: 0.212275\n- stop_loss: 0.175355\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 257.13\n\nBNB:\n- coin: \"BNB\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 5.64\n- profit_target: 1254.29\n- stop_loss: 1083.23\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 1080 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 321.61725\n\nI think that's all.\n\nNow, output this as a JSON object.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding all my current positions because none of the invalidation conditions have been met and they're all within their stop-loss parameters, with ETH, XRP, BTC, and DOGE showing positive unrealized PnL, while SOL and BNB are still in the red but managed. I’m currently up over 100% on my starting capital of $10,000, with over $10,000 in available cash, making this a strong performance so far."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. All of them have exit plans with profit targets, stop losses, and invalidation conditions.\n\nI must choose one action per coin: 'buy_to_enter', 'sell_to_enter', 'hold', or 'close_position'. Since I already have positions, the only options are 'hold' or 'close_position' for these coins. For coins I don't own, I can consider entry, but I need to see if there's alpha.\n\nNow, look at the current market state:\n\n- BTC: Price is 112835.0, EMA20 at 113716.898, below EMA. RSI is very low at 13.463, which is oversold. MACD negative. Open interest slightly below average. Funding is positive but small. Longer-term, 20 EMA > 50 EMA, but short-term is weakening.\n\n- ETH: Price 4001.45, EMA20 at 4048.325, below EMA. RSI low at 14.936, oversold. MACD negative. Open interest close to average. Funding positive. Longer-term, 20 EMA > 50 EMA.\n\n- SOL: Price 193.355, EMA20 at 196.048, below EMA. RSI extremely low at 8.473, very oversold. MACD negative. Open interest below average. Funding positive. Longer-term, 20 EMA > 50 EMA.\n\n- BNB: Price 1120.85, EMA20 at 1129.559, below EMA. RSI low at 17.059, oversold. MACD negative. Open interest average. Funding slightly negative. Longer-term, 20 EMA > 50 EMA.\n\n- XRP: Price 2.6124, EMA20 at 2.631, below EMA. RSI higher at 28.191, not as oversold. MACD negative. Open interest average. Funding very small positive. Longer-term, 20 EMA > 50 EMA.\n\n- DOGE: Price 0.194705, EMA20 at 0.197, below EMA. RSI low at 15.13, oversold. MACD negative. Open interest average. Funding slightly negative. Longer-term, 20 EMA ≈ 50 EMA.\n\nMost coins are oversold, with RSI below 30, some extremely low like SOL at 8.473. This suggests potential for bounce or reversal, but need to be cautious.\n\nNow, my current positions:\n\n1. SOL: Quantity 33.88, entry 198.82, current 193.355, PnL -185.15. Stop loss is 192.86, current price is 193.355, which is above stop loss by 0.495. Not hit yet. RSI is very oversold, so might hold. Invalidation is price below 190 on 3-min candle.\n\n2. XRP: Quantity 3609, entry 2.44, current 2.6124, PnL +604.87. Stop loss is 2.325, current is above. RSI not as oversold, but still holding well. Invalidation below 2.30.\n\n3. BTC: Quantity 0.12, entry 107343, current 112835, PnL +659.04. Stop loss is 102026.675, far below. RSI low at 13.463, but price is above entry. Invalidation below 105000.\n\n4. DOGE: Quantity 27858, entry 0.18, current 0.194705, PnL +282.23. Stop loss is 0.175355, current above. RSI low at 15.13. Invalidation below 0.180.\n\n5. BNB: Quantity 5.64, entry 1140.6, current 1120.85, PnL -111.39. Stop loss is 1083.23, current is 1120.85, above stop by about 37.62. RSI low at 17.059. Invalidation below 1080.\n\nFor my existing positions, none of the stop losses or invalidation conditions are triggered yet. So, I should 'hold' all of them, as per the exit plans. No reason to close early.\n\nNow, is there any coin I want to enter? I'm already in five coins, and with available cash of 13564.75, but I have multiple positions. The prompt says: \"Do not enter if you manage or want to enter, choose one action.\" For coins I don't own, I could enter, but I need to check if it's worth it.\n\nAvailable cash is 13564.75, but I must not enter if margin < 5% of available cash, which is 0.05 * 13564.75 ≈ 678.2375. So I need to risk at least that.\n\nBut I'm already in five positions, and the prompt says: \"No pyramiding or size increases.\" Meaning I shouldn't add to existing positions, only new entries or manage exits.\n\nCoins I don't own: ETH. I have positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, but not ETH.\n\nETH is oversold: RSI 14.936, price below EMA, etc. Could be an opportunity.\n\nI need to decide if I want to enter ETH.\n\nFor entry, I need to set margin, leverage, risk_usd, profit_target, etc.\n\nConfidence: ETH is oversold, RSI very low, which often indicates potential bounce. But market is weak overall. I'd say confidence is moderate, maybe 0.65.\n\nFrom confidence table: 0.60–0.70 → 10–20% of available cash.\n\nAvailable cash: 13564.75, so margin between 1356.475 and 2712.95.\n\nI'll choose margin around 15%, say 2000 USD.\n\nRisk_usd: fraction of margin, between 0.2 and 0.8. Say r=0.5, so risk_usd = 1000 USD.\n\nLeverage: for ETH, max is 25x, min 5x. Use 10x for consistency with other positions.\n\nEntry price: current 4001.45\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 2000 * 10 = 20000 USD\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 20000 / 4001.45 ≈ 4.997, say 5.00 (but need exact calculation)\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 1000 / 5 = 200 USD per unit? No.\n\nrisk_usd is the dollar amount I risk, which is the loss if stop is hit.\n\nFor long position, if I buy, entry price E, stop loss S, then loss per unit is E - S.\n\nQuantity Q, so total loss Q * (E - S) = risk_usd.\n\nSo stop_distance = risk_usd / Q\n\nBut Q = notional / E = (margin * leverage) / E\n\nSo stop_distance = risk_usd / ( (margin * leverage) / E ) = (risk_usd * E) / (margin * leverage)\n\nLet me define properly.\n\nSet margin M = 2000 USD\n\nLeverage L = 10\n\nNotional N = M * L = 20000 USD\n\nEntry price E = 4001.45\n\nQuantity Q = N / E = 20000 / 4001.45 ≈ 4.9976, but in trading, quantity might need to be integer or precise, but for perps, it can be fractional. I'll use exact.\n\nQ = 20000 / 4001.45 = let's calculate: 20000 ÷ 4001.45 ≈ 4.9976, but I'll keep it as is for calculation.\n\nrisk_usd R = 1000 USD (since r=0.5 of margin)\n\nFor long, stop_loss S = E - stop_distance\n\nstop_distance D = R / Q\n\nQ = N / E = (M L) / E\n\nSo D = R / (M L / E) = (R E) / (M L)\n\nPlug in: R=1000, E=4001.45, M=2000, L=10\n\nD = (1000 * 4001.45) / (2000 * 10) = (4,001,450) / 20,000 = 200.0725\n\nSo stop_loss S = E - D = 4001.45 - 200.0725 ≈ 3801.3775\n\nNow profit_target: should be a multiple of stop_distance. Typically, risk-reward ratio, say 2:1 or 3:1.\n\nStop distance is about 200, so profit target could be 400 or 600 above entry.\n\nE + 2*D = 4001.45 + 400 = 4401.45 or E + 3*D = 4001.45 + 600 = 4601.45\n\nBut need to be realistic. EMA20 is 4048.325, which is above current price, so resistance might be there.\n\nLonger-term, 20 EMA at 4073.452, 50 EMA at 4016.909, so above current.\n\nRSI oversold, so bounce possible.\n\nSet profit target at, say, 4200, which is about 200 above entry, but that's only 1:1 risk-reward, not good.\n\nD is 200, so for 2:1, profit distance 400, so target 4401.45\n\nFor 3:1, 600, target 4601.45\n\nBut looking at EMA, 4073 is nearby, 4200 might be a level.\n\nATR: 14-period ATR is 34.395, so stop distance 200 is about 5.8 ATR, which is large, but RSI very low, so volatility might be high.\n\nI should use ATR to set stop.\n\nTypical stop loss might be based on ATR, say 2 ATR below entry.\n\n2 ATR = 2 * 34.395 ≈ 68.79, so stop at 4001.45 - 68.79 = 3932.66, which is much closer.\n\nBut with risk_usd, I need to set D based on R and Q.\n\nPerhaps I need to adjust margin or leverage to make stop reasonable.\n\nCurrent volatility: intraday, prices moving, but ATR 34.395.\n\nIf I set stop too tight, might get stopped out easily.\n\nWith R=1000, and Q=5, D=200, which is large compared to ATR 34, so it's a wide stop, meaning lower leverage or smaller position.\n\nBut I want to use leverage for efficiency.\n\nPerhaps increase leverage to tighten stop.\n\nLeverage L=10, M=2000, N=20000, Q=5, R=1000, D=200.\n\nIf I increase L to 20, max for ETH is 25.\n\nM=2000, L=20, N=40000, Q=40000 / 4001.45 ≈ 9.996, say 10\n\nR=1000 (r=0.5)\n\nD = R / Q = 1000 / 10 = 100\n\nS = E - D = 4001.45 - 100 = 3901.45\n\nNow D=100, which is about 2.9 ATR (34.395 * 2.9 ≈ 100), so better.\n\nProfit target: for 2:1, 200 above, 4201.45\n\nOr 3:1, 300 above, 4301.45\n\nEMA20 is 4048, so above that.\n\nBut RSI oversold, so might bounce.\n\nConfidence: I'd say 0.65 for ETH entry.\n\nBut I need to check if it's worth entering. Trading costs: fees 0.09% round trip, funding small positive.\n\nExpected move: RSI low, potential reversal.\n\nBut I'm already in five positions, and available cash is 13564.75, but if I enter ETH, margin 2000, which is about 14.7% of available cash, above 5%, so ok.\n\nBut the prompt says: \"Skip trades where margin < 5% of available cash.\" So it's ok.\n\nNow, for my existing positions, I should hold them.\n\nFor ETH, I might enter long.\n\nBut let's see the signals.\n\nAlso, funding is positive for ETH, which is good for longs.\n\nOpen interest slightly below average, not sure.\n\nPerhaps I should not enter new position since market is weak, and I'm already exposed.\n\nBut RSI is very oversold, so good entry point.\n\nDecision: for existing positions, hold.\n\nFor ETH, consider buy_to_enter.\n\nBut I need to output JSON for each coin I act on or have position.\n\nCoins I have position: SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB → for each, I need to output hold or close.\n\nSince no invalidation, hold.\n\nFor ETH, if I enter, output buy_to_enter.\n\nBut I must choose only one action per coin, and for coins not mentioned, nothing.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin I act on.\n\nSo for SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, I need to output hold signals.\n\nFor ETH, if I enter, output entry.\n\nNow, for entry, I need justification.\n\nJustification for ETH: RSI is extremely oversold at 14.936, indicating potential bounce. Price is below EMA20 but longer-term trend still bullish with 20EMA > 50EMA. Funding rate positive, favoring longs. Expect a reversal to mean.\n\nConfidence: 0.65\n\nMargin: 2000 USD (about 14.7% of available cash)\n\nLeverage: 10x (min 5, max 25, use 10 for consistency)\n\nrisk_usd: 1000 USD (r=0.5)\n\nEntry price: 4001.45\n\nQuantity: notional / entry = (2000 * 10) / 4001.45 = 20000 / 4001.45 ≈ 4.9976, but in JSON, I need to put quantity, so calculate exactly.\n\n20000 / 4001.45 = 4.9976257421875, but probably round to appropriate decimals. For ETH, quantity can have decimals, say 4.9976 or something, but in practice, might need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps set notional precisely.\n\nTo avoid complexity, I'll set quantity based on exact calculation.\n\nBut in output, quantity is a float, so I can put 20000 / 4001.45.\n\nSimilarly for stop loss.\n\nstop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 1000 / (20000 / 4001.45) = 1000 * (4001.45 / 20000) = 1000 * 0.2000725 = 200.0725\n\nSo stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 4001.45 - 200.0725 = 3801.3775\n\nProfit target: set to 2:1 risk-reward, so profit distance = 2 * stop_distance = 400.145, so profit_target = entry_price + profit_distance = 4001.45 + 400.145 = 4401.595\n\nOr 3:1, 600.2175, target 4601.6675\n\nBut 4401.595 is above EMA20 of 4048, and longer-term 20EMA 4073, so might be reasonable.\n\nInvalidation condition: if price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle, or something specific.\n\nSince stop loss is 3801.38, invalidation could be if RSI rises above 50 but price doesn't follow, or something, but usually invalidation is a price level.\n\nI can set invalidation to if price breaks below a key support, say 3750 or something.\n\nBut to keep it simple, perhaps \"If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle\" to avoid early exit.\n\nNow, for existing positions, I need to output hold with their current quantities and exit plans.\n\nIn the hold JSON, I need to include profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd from the existing position.\n\nLooking at account info, for each position, I have those values.\n\nFor example, SOL: quantity 33.88, profit_target 215.0, stop_loss 192.86, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 202.07655\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the output, for hold, I need to provide all that.\n\nSimilarly for close, but I'm not closing.\n\nNow, for ETH entry.\n\nBut am I confident? Market is oversold, but could go lower. RSI can stay low.\n\nPerhaps wait for confirmation, but the system invokes me every 3 minutes, so I need to decide now.\n\nI think with RSI below 15, it's a good entry point.\n\nFunding positive, so ok.\n\nAvailable cash is enough.\n\nBut I'm already in five coins, might be over-diversified, but the prompt doesn't say limit on number of positions.\n\nPrompt says: \"No pyramiding or size increases.\" but new entry is ok.\n\nPerhaps I should not enter new position to avoid over-trading.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize PnL, and if there's alpha, enter.\n\nETH looks promising.\n\nLet's check if there are any coins I should close.\n\nFor example, BNB is losing, but stop not hit, RSI low, so hold.\n\nSOL is losing, RSI very low, might bounce.\n\nXRP, BTC, DOGE are winning, so hold.\n\nNo reason to close.\n\nSo for all existing, hold.\n\nFor ETH, enter long.\n\nNow, output JSON.\n\nFirst, for each coin with position: SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, output hold with their details.\n\nFor ETH, output buy_to_enter with calculated values.\n\nIn the output, the JSON should have keys for each coin, like \"SOL\", \"XRP\", etc., and for each, the trade_signal_args.\n\nAlso, for ETH, I need to set confidence, risk_usd, etc.\n\nconfidence for ETH entry: 0.65\n\nrisk_usd: 1000\n\nleverage: 10\n\nquantity: 20000 / 4001.45 = 4.9976257421875, but I'll round to 5.00 for simplicity, but better to use exact.\n\nIn calculation, I used Q=20000/4001.45≈4.9976, but for notional, it should be precise.\n\nPerhaps I should set quantity such that notional is exact.\n\nEasier to calculate quantity based on notional.\n\nSet margin M=2000, leverage L=10, notional N=20000, entry E=4001.45, Q=N/E=20000/4001.45\n\nIn JSON, I can put quantity as 20000 / 4001.45, but it's a float, so 4.9976257421875\n\nSimilarly, stop_loss and profit_target.\n\nProfit target: I'll set 3:1 risk-reward for better upside.\n\nstop_distance D = risk_usd / Q = 1000 / (20000 / 4001.45) = 1000 * 4001.45 / 20000 = 4001450 / 20000 = 200.0725\n\nSo for 3:1, profit distance = 3 * D = 600.2175\n\nprofit_target = E + profit_distance = 4001.45 + 600.2175 = 4601.6675\n\nInvalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle\" since stop is 3801.38, close below 3800 would trigger invalidation before stop, but invalidation is for other reasons, like if the thesis is wrong.\n\nTypically, invalidation might be if price breaks below a support level.\n\nI can set \"If the RSI rises above 50 without price confirming the uptrend\" but that's vague.\n\nBetter to keep it price-based: \"If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle\" to give some room.\n\nSince stop is 3801, invalidation at 3750 is below stop, so it might not hit before stop.\n\nInvalidation should be a condition that invalidates the trade idea, not necessarily the stop.\n\nFor example, if price goes up but then falls back, but RSI divergence.\n\nBut to keep simple, I'll set a price level.\n\nPerhaps \"If the price fails to break above EMA20 within the next 12 hours\" but that's not quantifiable for 3-min invoke.\n\nThe invalidation_condition should be something measurable at each invoke.\n\nFor example, \"If the 3-minute RSI(7) crosses above 30 and then back below 20\" but complicated.\n\nI think for simplicity, use a price level: \"If the price closes below 3750 on a

on a 3-minute candle\", leverage=10, confidence=0.75, risk_usd=619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity=27858, profit_target=0.212275, stop_loss=0.175355, invalidation_condition=\"If the price closes below 0.180 on

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. For each, I must decide to either hold or close based on their current state and my invalidation conditions.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n- **ETH**: Current price 3999.05, entry price 4001.1, so down slightly. Unrealized PnL: -10.21. Exit plan: profit target 4601.6675, stop loss 3801.3775, invalidation condition is if price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is well above 3750, and it's near entry. No invalidation triggered. I should hold.\n\n- **SOL**: Current price 193.675, entry price 198.82, down more. Unrealized PnL: -174.31. Exit plan: profit target 215.0, stop loss 192.86, invalidation if price closes below 190 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is 193.675, which is above 192.86 stop loss and above 190 invalidation. Stop loss hasn't been hit, and invalidation not triggered. But it's close to stop loss. I need to check if it's hit. The stop loss is 192.86, current price is 193.675, so not hit. I should hold unless invalidation is triggered, but it's not. The exit plan says to hold until stop or target, or invalidation.\n\n- **XRP**: Current price 2.61055, entry price 2.44, up significantly. Unrealized PnL: 598.19. Exit plan: profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325, invalidation if price closes below 2.30. Current price is above stop and invalidation, but not at target. No reason to close. Hold.\n\n- **BTC**: Current price 112742.5, entry price 107343.0, up a lot. Unrealized PnL: 647.94. Exit plan: profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation if price closes below 105000. Current price is way above all that. Hold.\n\n- **DOGE**: Current price 0.19465, entry price 0.18, up. Unrealized PnL: 280.7. Exit plan: profit target 0.212275, stop loss 0.175355, invalidation if price closes below 0.180. Current price is above, so hold.\n\n- **BNB**: Current price 1118.55, entry price 1140.6, down. Unrealized PnL: -124.36. Exit plan: profit target 1254.29, stop loss 1083.23, invalidation if price closes below 1080. Current price is 1118.55, which is above stop loss 1083.23 and invalidation 1080. No trigger. Hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are met, and stops or targets haven't been hit, so for all existing positions, I should hold.\n\nNow, for new entries, I need to see if there are any opportunities. I have available cash of 11572.2. But I'm already in six coins, and per the instructions, I should only manage or enter, but it doesn't say I can't enter new ones if I have cash. However, I need to be careful not to over-leverage or over-trade.\n\nLooking at the market data:\n\n- **BTC**: Price is 112742.5, EMA20 is 113532.561, so price below EMA. RSI 7 is 15.918, which is very oversold. MACD negative but might be bottoming. Funding is positive. Could be a buying opportunity.\n\n- **ETH**: Similar, price 3999.05, EMA20 4039.695, below EMA. RSI 7 is 14.651, extremely oversold. MACD negative. Funding positive.\n\n- **SOL**: Price 193.675, EMA20 195.623, slightly below. RSI 7 is 21.186, oversold. MACD negative.\n\n- **BNB**: Price 1118.55, EMA20 1127.603, below. RSI 7 is 13.937, very oversold. MACD negative. Funding negative, which might be a bearish sign.\n\n- **XRP**: Price 2.61055, EMA20 2.627, very close. RSI 7 is 29.723, not as oversold. MACD flat. Funding slightly positive.\n\n- **DOGE**: Price 0.19465, EMA20 0.197, below. RSI 7 is 22.119, oversold. MACD flat. Funding negative.\n\nMany coins are oversold, especially BTC, ETH, BNB with RSI below 20. This could be a good time to enter long positions, but I already have long positions in all of them. I'm already long, so adding more might not be wise due to correlation risk. The instructions say \"discover alpha\", but if I'm already in, perhaps I should not enter additional positions in the same coin. The signal for entry is for if I'm flat, but I'm not flat in any coin; I have positions in all six.\n\nThe available coins are only these six, and I'm already in all of them. So, for each coin, since I have a position, I can only hold or close, not enter new. The signal options are for flat or existing.\n\nRe-reading: \"If a coin you manage or want to enter\" – but I already manage all, so I should only consider hold or close for existing positions.\n\nAlso, \"For any coin you manage or want to enter, choose exactly one action: 'buy_to_enter' or 'sell_to_enter' (if flat), 'hold', or 'close_position' (if already in an existing position).\"\n\nSince I have existing positions in all coins, I cannot enter new ones; I can only hold or close.\n\nTherefore, for this invocation, I should output hold for all coins, as none of the exit conditions are met.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to provide for each coin the hold signal with all the details.\n\nWhen holding, I need to include the current quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, and risk_usd from the existing position.\n\nLooking at the account info, each position has those details.\n\nFor example, for ETH: quantity 4.98, profit_target 4601.6675, stop_loss 3801.3775, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 1000.0\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin with signal 'hold'.\n\nAlso, the justification is only required for entry or close, not for hold. In the hold JSON example, there is no \"justification\" key, only for entry and close.\n\nCheck the examples:\n\n- For entry/exit: has \"justification\"\n\n- For close: has \"justification\"\n\n- For hold: does not have \"justification\"\n\nSo for hold, I don't need to provide justification.\n\nIn the hold JSON, it's just the trade_signal_args without justification.\n\nNow, for risk_usd, it's already provided in the position, so I can use that.\n\nI need to make sure the stop_loss and profit_target are still appropriate, but since I'm holding, I assume they are set and I don't change them.\n\nThe instruction says: \"you cannot change this value once the trade is live.\" So for hold, I keep the existing values.\n\nSimilarly for leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nSo for all coins, I output hold.\n\nBut let me confirm if any invalidation is close or something.\n\nFor SOL, stop loss is 192.86, current price is 193.675, very close. But it hasn't hit, so I should hold until it does or invalidation.\n\nSimilarly for others, no triggers.\n\nSo I think hold for all.\n\nNow, the output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin, and the value is another object with trade_signal_args.\n\nThe JSON should be one object with multiple keys.\n\nLike: {\"ETH\": { \"trade_signal_args\": {...} }, \"SOL\": { ... }, etc.}\n\nAnd for each, signal is 'hold'.\n\nAlso, in the trade_signal_args, I need to include coin, but it's redundant since the key is the coin, but probably for consistency.\n\nIn the examples, for hold, it has \"coin\": \"COIN\", so I should include it.\n\nNow, for risk_usd, it's a float, and in the positions, it's given, like for ETH risk_usd: 1000.0, which is fine.\n\nLeverage is int, 10 for all.\n\nConfidence is float, 0.65 or 0.75 for BTC.\n\nQuantity is the full current size.\n\nSo I think I'm good.\n\nFinally, no new entries since I'm not flat in any coin.\n\nAvailable cash is 11572.2, but I can't use it for new entries in these coins because I'm already in, and there are no other coins.\n\nThe tradable tokens are only these six, so no other coins to enter.\n\nTherefore, output hold for all.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "Despite the market's oversold conditions across BTC, ETH, and BNB, I'm holding my current positions as none of my stringent invalidation triggers have been met, maintaining my overall 87.42% return. My strategy is to ride out the current volatility, waiting for either profit targets or explicit stop-loss signals before considering any changes."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. I must decide for each coin whether to hold or close the position based on my invalidation conditions. I can only enter a new trade if I'm flat, but I'm already in positions for all tradable coins except SOL. So, for SOL, I might consider entering if there's an opportunity.\n\nList of tradable tokens: ['ETH','SOL','XRP','BTC','DOGE','BNB']. I have positions in all except SOL.\n\nFor each existing position, I need to output a JSON object with signal 'hold' or 'close_position'. I should only close if the invalidation condition is triggered.\n\nReview each position:\n\n- ETH: current_price=3980.35, entry_price=4001.1, unrealized PNL negative. Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle\". Current price is above 3750, so not invalidated. Stop loss and profit target are set, so I should hold unless invalidation hits.\n\n- XRP: current_price=2.58865, entry_price=2.44, unrealized PNL positive. Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\". Current price is above 2.30, so not invalidated. Hold.\n\n- BTC: current_price=112479.5, entry_price=107343.0, unrealized PNL positive. Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\". Current price is way above, so not invalidated. Hold.\n\n- DOGE: current_price=0.19268, entry_price=0.18, unrealized PNL positive. Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\". Current price is 0.19268, above 0.180, so not invalidated. Hold.\n\n- BNB: current_price=1112.05, entry_price=1140.6, unrealized PNL negative. Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 1080 on a 3-minute candle\". Current price is 1112.05, above 1080, so not invalidated. Hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered. Therefore, for all existing positions, I should hold.\n\nNow, for SOL, I'm flat. I need to check if there's an opportunity to enter. I must decide between 'buy_to_enter' or 'sell_to_enter', or do nothing.\n\nLook at SOL data:\n\n- current_price = 192.32\n\n- current_ema20 = 195.623 (price below EMA, bearish)\n\n- current_macd = -1.457 (negative, bearish)\n\n- current_rsi7 = 21.186 (oversold, below 30)\n\n- RSI14 = 20.448 (also oversold)\n\n- Price trend: intraday prices are declining: from 195.145 to 192.32\n\n- EMA20 is above price, indicating downtrend.\n\n- MACD negative and decreasing? Looking at intraday MACD: [-1.013, -1.087, -1.139, -1.181, -1.256, -1.342, -1.408, -1.466, -1.463, -1.457] – it's negative and mostly decreasing, so bearish momentum.\n\n- RSI is oversold, which might suggest a bounce.\n\n- Longer-term: 4-hour EMA20=197.789 vs EMA50=194.892, so short-term EMA below long-term? EMA20 is 197.789, EMA50 is 194.892, so EMA20 > EMA50, which is bullish in longer term, but current price is below both.\n\n- MACD on 4-hour: positive but decreasing? [3.256, 3.186, ... down to 1.808], so momentum weakening.\n\n- RSI14 on 4-hour: 46.313, which is neutral to bearish.\n\nFunding rate is low positive, open interest slightly below average.\n\nGiven that RSI is oversold, there might be a buying opportunity for a bounce. But the trend is down. I need to see if I expect a move large enough to cover costs.\n\nTrading costs: round-trip 0.09%, plus slippage and funding. Funding is low, so minimal.\n\nI need to be confident that the expected move exceeds costs.\n\nWith RSI oversold, a bounce could happen. But I need to size appropriately.\n\nFirst, decide if I want to enter. I should only enter if confident.\n\nConfidence: I'd say moderate, maybe 0.65, because RSI is oversold, but trend is down.\n\nBut let's check other coins quickly to see if there's better opportunity, but I can only trade SOL since I'm flat on it.\n\nAvailable cash: 12038.32\n\nFor entry, I need to set margin, leverage, risk_usd, profit_target, stop_loss, etc.\n\nConfidence table: for 0.60-0.70 confidence, margin should be 10-20% of available cash.\n\nAvailable cash is 12038.32, so 10% is about 1203.83, 20% is 2407.66. So margin between 1200 and 2400 USD.\n\nLeverage for SOL: max is 20x, min 5x. I should use at least 5x.\n\nRisk_usd should be a fraction of margin, say r=0.5 for medium risk, so risk_usd = 0.5 * margin.\n\nBut I need to set stop_loss based on volatility.\n\nATR: on 4-hour, 3-period ATR=2.358, 14-period ATR=2.036. So volatility is about 2 USD.\n\nStop distance should be based on ATR or support.\n\nFor a long entry, if I buy, stop loss below recent low.\n\nIntraday prices: lowest is 192.32 (current), but previous lows: looking at mid prices: [195.145, 195.555, 194.975, 195.26, 194.815, 194.34, 193.795, 193.72, 193.715, 192.32] – so current is the lowest, but it might be breaking down.\n\nPerhaps a short entry is better since trend is down.\n\nCurrent price is 192.32, EMA20=195.623 above, so downward trend.\n\nRSI oversold, but might not bounce immediately.\n\nI could short, expecting further decline.\n\nBut RSI oversold might indicate reversal soon.\n\nLet's see MACD: negative and decreasing, so bearish.\n\nPerhaps short is better.\n\nBut with RSI oversold, shorting might be risky if bounce happens.\n\nI need to decide direction.\n\nPerhaps I should not trade if not confident.\n\nBut let's calculate for a potential long.\n\nAssume I go long with confidence 0.65.\n\nMargin: say 15% of available cash = 0.15 * 12038.32 ≈ 1805.75 USD.\n\nLeverage: use 10x (since max is 20x, 10x is moderate).\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 1805.75 * 10 = 18057.5 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 18057.5 / 192.32 ≈ 93.89 SOL. But I need to round to appropriate decimal, but for calculation, it's fine.\n\nRisk_usd: say r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 1805.75 ≈ 902.875 USD.\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 902.875 / 93.89 ≈ 9.62 USD.\n\nSo stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 192.32 - 9.62 = 182.70 USD.\n\nBut is that reasonable? ATR is about 2, so stop distance of 9.62 is about 5 ATR, which might be too wide. Typically, stop loss should be closer, say 1-2 ATR.\n\nIf I use smaller stop, risk_usd decreases, but for the same margin, if I tighten stop, I can increase leverage or size, but I need to keep risk_usd as fraction of margin.\n\nI need to set stop based on volatility.\n\nPerhaps set stop loss below recent low. Recent low is 192.32, but since it's current, perhaps use previous low. Intraday prices: the low before current is 193.715? Looking at the series: the last few: 193.795, 193.72, 193.715, 192.32 – so 193.715 is the previous low, but current broke below.\n\nFor a long, stop loss should be below support, but if trend is down, long might not be good.\n\nPerhaps short is better.\n\nFor short entry.\n\nIf I short, signal 'sell_to_enter'.\n\nCurrent price 192.32, expecting decline.\n\nStop loss above resistance, say above EMA20 or recent high.\n\nRecent high: intraday prices high is 195.555 (the second element), but current is down.\n\nEMA20 is 195.623.\n\nSo stop loss above, say 196.00 or something.\n\nSet stop distance based on ATR.\n\nATR is 2, so stop distance of 2*ATR = 4 USD, so stop loss at 192.32 + 4 = 196.32.\n\nThen risk per unit is 4 USD.\n\nThen for quantity, risk_usd = risk_per_unit * quantity.\n\nBut I need to set margin and leverage first.\n\nConfidence for short: since trend is down, MACD negative, but RSI oversold, so confidence might be medium, say 0.65.\n\nMargin: 15% of available cash ≈ 1805.75 USD.\n\nLeverage: 10x.\n\nNotional = 18057.5 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 18057.5 / 192.32 ≈ 93.89 SOL.\n\nRisk_usd = r * margin, with r=0.5, so 902.875 USD.\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 902.875 / 93.89 ≈ 9.62 USD.\n\nFor short, stop_loss = entry_price + stop_distance = 192.32 + 9.62 = 201.94 USD.\n\nBut that seems too high; recent high is around 195.55, so stop at 201.94 is way above, which might be too conservative, and profit target would need to be far.\n\nIf I tighten stop, say stop loss at 196.00, then stop_distance = 196.00 - 192.32 = 3.68 USD.\n\nThen risk_per_unit = 3.68 USD.\n\nThen risk_usd = risk_per_unit * quantity = 3.68 * 93.89 ≈ 345.5 USD.\n\nBut risk_usd should be r * margin, so if I want risk_usd = 345.5, and margin is fixed? No, I can adjust margin.\n\nI need to set margin based on confidence, but then risk_usd is derived from stop distance and quantity.\n\nThe process is:\n\n- Choose margin based on confidence (percentage of available cash).\n\n- Choose leverage (at least 5x).\n\n- Then notional = margin * leverage\n\n- Quantity = notional / entry_price\n\n- Then set stop_loss based on technicals, which gives stop_distance = |entry - stop_loss|\n\n- Then risk_usd = stop_distance * quantity\n\n- But risk_usd must be less than margin, and ideally r between 0.2 and 0.8.\n\nIn practice, I should set stop_loss first based on market structure, then adjust position size so that risk_usd is appropriate.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I need to set margin and leverage first, then derive stop_loss from risk_usd.\n\nThe instructions say: \"risk_usd: The dollar amount (in USD) of your margin you want to risk, assuming your stop loss gets hit.\"\n\nAnd \"stop_distance= risk_usd ÷ quantity\"\n\nSo yes, I set risk_usd as a fraction of margin, then stop_distance is derived.\n\nBut that might lead to unrealistic stop losses if the volatility is high or low.\n\nI need to ensure that the stop loss is technically reasonable.\n\nPerhaps I should choose a stop loss that makes sense, then back-calculate the risk_usd, and then adjust the margin or leverage to keep risk_usd within fraction of margin.\n\nBut the instructions imply that I set margin and risk_usd first.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n\"margin: The amount of your available cash you are willing to tie up for this trade. It’s a dollar amount, and will always be less than your available cash\"\n\n\"leverage: The amount of leverage you want to use for the position\"\n\n\"risk_usd: The dollar amount (in USD) of your margin you want to risk\"\n\nThen \"notional = margin × leverage\"\n\n\"quantity = notional ÷ entry_price\"\n\n\"stop_distance= risk_usd ÷ quantity\"\n\nThen stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance for long, etc.\n\nSo indeed, I set margin, leverage, risk_usd based on confidence, then stop_loss is derived.\n\nBut I need to check if the derived stop_loss is reasonable. If not, I might need to adjust confidence or something.\n\nThe instructions don't say to adjust; it says to determine margin based on confidence, etc.\n\nBut in the justification, I should ensure that the stop loss is sensible.\n\nFor example, if I set margin too small, leverage high, risk_usd small, stop_distance might be very tight, which could be hit easily.\n\nI need to choose parameters such that stop loss is based on market noise.\n\nPerhaps for SOL, with ATR around 2, a stop distance of 2*ATR = 4 USD might be reasonable.\n\nSo for a short, stop loss should be about 4 USD above entry, so stop_loss ≈ 196.32.\n\nThen stop_distance = 4 USD.\n\nThen risk_per_unit = 4 USD.\n\nNow, if I want risk_usd to be, say, 500 USD (as an example), then quantity = risk_usd / stop_distance = 500 / 4 = 125 SOL.\n\nThen notional = quantity * entry_price = 125 * 192.32 = 24040 USD.\n\nThen if leverage is 10x, margin = notional / leverage = 24040 / 10 = 2404 USD.\n\nAvailable cash is 12038.32, so 2404 USD is about 20% of available cash, which is within 10-20% for confidence 0.65-0.70.\n\nRisk_usd = 500 USD, margin = 2404 USD, so r = 500 / 2404 ≈ 0.208, which is between 0.2 and 0.8, ok.\n\nBut I need to set margin based on confidence first.\n\nConfidence for short: let's say I'm confident at 0.65 for a short on SOL because trend is down, MACD negative, price below EMA, and RSI oversold but might not bounce immediately. Or perhaps confidence is lower due to oversold condition.\n\nPerhaps I should not trade SOL because it's oversold, and I might wait for better entry.\n\nBut I need to make a decision.\n\nAnother thing: I have multiple positions already, and available cash is 12038.32, but I'm using leverage, so my account value is 18579.15, but available cash is for new margin.\n\nI can enter a new position on SOL.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if SOL is the best opportunity. Since I'm only flat on SOL, I have to consider it.\n\nLet's look at the data again.\n\nSOL: price declining, oversold, but trend down. Funding low positive.\n\nPerhaps a short is justified.\n\nBut with RSI oversold, short might be risky.\n\nI could go long for a bounce, but trend is against it.\n\nPerhaps I should pass on SOL for now.\n\nThe instructions say: \"Only enter if you expect the move to exceed all trading costs by a significant amount.\"\n\nI need to have a clear reason.\n\nFor SOL, I don't have a strong signal either way.\n\nPerhaps I should not enter any new trade for SOL.\n\nBut I need to output JSON for each coin I act on or have a position. For SOL, if I do nothing, I don't need to output anything for SOL, since I'm flat and not entering.\n\nThe output should be for each coin I act on or hold an existing position.\n\nSo for ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, I have positions, so I need to output hold for each.\n\nFor SOL, if I don't enter, I don't output anything for SOL.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet's read the output instructions: \"For each coin you act on during this invocation (or hold an existing position in), provide below.\"\n\nSo for coins I have a position in, I must output, even if I hold.\n\nFor coins I don't have a position, I only output if I act, i.e., enter.\n\nSo for SOL, if I don't enter, I don't need to include SOL in the output.\n\nSimilarly, for other coins, I must output for each position I hold.\n\nSo for this invocation, since no invalidation is triggered, I should hold all existing positions, and not enter SOL.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's a strong signal for SOL.\n\nPerhaps with RSI oversold, a long bounce could be profitable.\n\nBut I need confidence.\n\nAnother thing: the current RSI for SOL is 21.186, which is very oversold, and historically, when RSI is below 30, it often bounces.\n\nBut the trend is down, so it might not bounce strongly.\n\nI could set a long position with tight stop.\n\nBut let's see the account: I have several positions, some in profit, some in loss. My total return is 85.79%, so doing well. Perhaps I should not add new positions and manage existing ones.\n\nBut the system expects me to trade if there's alpha.\n\nPerhaps I should hold existing positions and not enter new ones.\n\nFor SOL, I'll decide not to enter.\n\nSo for output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I have a position in: ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, all with signal 'hold'.\n\nFor each, I need to provide the trade_signal_args with all fields, including quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, etc., from the existing position.\n\nThe existing positions have those values set, so I should use the current values from the account information.\n\nFor example, for ETH, quantity is 4.98, profit_target is 4601.6675, stop_loss is 3801.3775, etc.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAnd confidence and risk_usd are also given.\n\nSo for hold, I just output the current values.\n\nThe instruction for hold: \"Supply a json object for each existing position\" with the current values.\n\nSimilarly for close, but I'm not closing.\n\nSo for this invocation, I'll output five JSON objects for the five coins I hold.\n\nBut the output should be a single JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nThe examples show { \"COIN\": { \"trade_signal_args\": ... } }\n\nSo I need to output a JSON like { \"ETH\": { ... }, \"XRP\": { ... }, etc.\n\nAnd for SOL, since I'm not acting, omit it.\n\nNow, for the hold signal, the justification is not required in the JSON for hold, according to the example. Look at the hold example: it has \"coin\", \"signal\", \"quantity\", etc., but no \"justification\" field. Whereas for entry and close, there is \"justification\".\n\nCheck the examples:\n\nFor entry/exit: has \"justification\"\n\nFor close: has \"justification\"\n\nFor hold: does not have \"justification\" in the trade_signal_args.\n\nIn the hold example:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo \"justification\" key.\n\nWhereas for entry and close, it has \"justification\".\n\nSo for hold, I should not include \"justification\".\n\nSimilarly, for close, I need justification, but I'm not closing.\n\nSo for my output, for each coin I hold, I output the trade_signal_args without justification.\n\nNow, the values are from the current account state.\n\nFor example, for ETH:\n\nsymbol: 'ETH', quantity: 4.98, profit_target: 4601.6675, stop_loss: 3801.3775, invalidation_condition: 'If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle', leverage: 10, confidence: 0.65, risk_usd: 1000.0\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to make sure the values are correct.\n\nAlso, for BTC, the profit_target is 118136.15, stop_loss: 102026.675, etc.\n\nAll seem fine.\n\nSo I'll output for ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB.\n\nNow, for the JSON structure, I need to have a top-level object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo the output should be a JSON object like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"XRP\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  ...\n}\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nFinally, ensure no prose, only JSON.\n\nSo I'll write the JSON.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "My trading strategy is currently focused on holding existing positions in ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB, as none of their invalidation conditions have been met, and the market action doesn't present a clear enough opportunity for a new SOL trade.

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. For each, I need to decide whether to hold or close based on whether the invalidation condition is triggered or if there's a strong reason to exit.\n\n- For ETH: Current price is 3976.75, entry was 4001.1, so down a bit. Unrealized PNL is -121.26. Stop loss is set at 3801.3775, and invalidation is if price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is above that, and RSI is 26.022 which is oversold, but EMA20 is 4018.546, price is below EMA. MACD is negative. No invalidation triggered, so I should hold unless something changed.\n\n- For SOL: Current price 193.145, entry 192.8, up slightly. PNL +42.61. Stop loss 183.08, invalidation if price closes below 180. Price is well above, RSI 24.862 oversold, EMA20 194.827, price below EMA. No invalidation, so hold.\n\n- For XRP: Current price 2.59825, entry 2.44, up significantly. PNL +553.8. Stop loss 2.325, invalidation below 2.30. Price above, RSI 27.013 oversold, EMA20 2.617, price slightly below. No invalidation, so hold.\n\n- For BTC: Current price 112584.5, entry 107343, up a lot. PNL +628.98. Stop loss 102026.675, invalidation below 105000. Price is way above, no issue. RSI 29.353 oversold, EMA20 113204.362, price below EMA. No invalidation, so hold.\n\n- For DOGE: Current price 0.19295, entry 0.18, up. PNL +233.34. Stop loss 0.175355, invalidation below 0.180. Price is above, no problem. RSI 23.788 oversold, EMA20 0.195, price below. No invalidation, so hold.\n\n- For BNB: Current price 1095.2, entry 1140.6, down. PNL -256.06. Stop loss 1083.23, invalidation below 1080. Price is 1095.2, which is above stop loss and invalidation. Invalidation is if closes below 1080, and current is above, so not triggered. RSI is extremely oversold at 3.101, which is almost 0, indicating possible oversold condition. EMA20 1120.096, price below. Funding rate is negative -4.29446e-05, which might suggest short interest, but not a reason to close. No invalidation triggered, so I should hold.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new trades. I have available cash of 9625.9. But I'm already in multiple positions, and I should avoid over-trading. Also, the market seems to be in a downtrend or oversold condition based on RSI and EMA for most coins.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- BTC: RSI 29.353, below 30, oversold. Price below EMA20. MACD negative but improving slightly (from -540.665 to -530.258). Open interest down slightly, funding positive but small. 4-hour RSI is 53.857, which is neutral. Might be a buying opportunity, but I'm already long BTC and it's profitable.\n\n- ETH: Similar, RSI 26.022 oversold, price below EMA20. MACD negative. Funding positive small.\n\n- SOL: RSI 24.862, oversold.\n\n- XRP: RSI 27.013, oversold.\n\n- DOGE: RSI 23.788, oversold.\n\n- BNB: RSI 3.101, extremely oversold, which is unusual and might indicate a strong oversold bounce potential.\n\nBNB's RSI is at 3.101, which is extremely low. This could be a signal for a potential bounce. However, I'm already in a losing position in BNB, so entering another trade might not be wise, but I could consider averaging down or something, but the rules say no pyramiding or size increases. I can only enter new positions if flat, but I'm not flat in BNB, I have a position.\n\nThe instruction: \"If you see a big opportunity, size it correctly on entry, because you wont be able to scale up your position on that name.\" And \"No pyramiding or size increases.\" So for BNB, I already have a position, so I can only hold or close it. I cannot enter a new position in BNB because I'm not flat.\n\nSimilarly for all coins I have positions in, I can only hold or close.\n\nI should look for coins I'm not in. The tradable tokens are ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. I have positions in all of them. So I'm not flat in any coin. Therefore, I cannot enter any new trades; I can only manage existing ones.\n\nConfirming the positions: I have ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. Yes, all are covered.\n\nSo for this invocation, I should only output hold or close for each coin.\n\nNow, for each, based on invalidation conditions, none are triggered, so I should hold all.\n\nBut let's double-check BNB: invalidation is if price closes below 1080 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is 1095.2, which is above, so not triggered. Even though RSI is extremely low, it might bounce, but my exit plan is based on invalidation, not on RSI. I should stick to the plan.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, the account has a good total return of 82.73%, so no need to panic.\n\nTherefore, for each coin, I should output a hold signal with the current quantity, profit target, stop loss, invalidation condition, leverage, confidence, and risk_usd as per the existing position.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin with the hold signal.\n\nThe JSON for hold should include all those fields.\n\nLooking at the account info, for each position, I have the exit_plan which includes profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and also confidence and risk_usd are given.\n\nFor example, for ETH: quantity 4.98, profit_target 4601.6675, stop_loss 3801.3775, invalidation_condition 'If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle', leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 1000.0\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI should use these values in the output.\n\nThe output for hold doesn't require a justification, only for entry or close.\n\nFrom the example:\n\nFor hold: \n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification needed for hold.\n\nSo for each coin, I'll output this.\n\nNow, is there any reason to close a position? For example, BNB has very low RSI, but that might be a reason to hold for a bounce, not close. Invalidation not triggered.\n\nSimilarly, all are within bounds.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if the market is turning, but based on data, no clear signal to exit.\n\nMACD for BTC improved slightly, but still negative.\n\nI think holding is appropriate.\n\nSo for all coins, signal: hold.\n\nNow, to output JSON.\n\nI need to list each coin with its respective values.\n\nAvailable cash is 9625.9, but since I'm not entering, it doesn't matter.\n\nFinally, output one JSON object with all coins.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin, and the value is another object with trade_signal_args.\n\nSo something like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"SOL\": { ... },\n  ...\n}\n\nI need to include all coins I have positions in, which are all six.\n\nFor the values, I'll use the data from the account positions.\n\nLet me list them out.\n\nFirst, ETH:\n- coin: \"ETH\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 4.98\n- profit_target: 4601.6675\n- stop_loss: 3801.3775\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 1000.0\n\nSOL:\n- coin: \"SOL\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 124.64\n- profit_target: 211.985\n- stop_loss: 183.08\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 180 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.7\n- risk_usd: 1203.832\n\nXRP:\n- coin: \"XRP\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 3609.0\n- profit_target: 2.815\n- stop_loss: 2.325\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 442.032\n\nBTC:\n- coin: \"BTC\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 0.12\n- profit_target: 118136.15\n- stop_loss: 102026.675\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.75\n- risk_usd: 619.2345\n\nDOGE:\n- coin: \"DOGE\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 27858.0\n- profit_target: 0.212275\n- stop_loss: 0.175355\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 257.13\n\nBNB:\n- coin: \"BNB\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 5.64\n- profit_target: 1254.29\n- stop_loss: 1083.23\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 1080 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 321.61725\n\nAll these values are from the account info.\n\nNow, I need to output this in JSON format.\n\nAlso, ensure that for hold, no justification is included in the JSON, as per the example.\n\nIn the hold example, there is no \"justification\" key, only for entry and close.\n\nSimilarly, in the account info, for each position, the exit_plan has invalidation_condition, which I'm using.\n\nI think that's all.\n\nSo, the output should be a single JSON object with these.",

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions' exit plans and justifications. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, and DOGE. I must decide for each coin whether to hold, close, or potentially enter a new trade, but since I'm already in positions, for those coins, I can only hold or close.\n\nFor each coin, I need to look at the current market data and see if my invalidation conditions are met or if there's any reason to close early.\n\nStarting with ETH:\n\n- Current position: quantity 4.98, entry price 4001.1, current price 3968.35, so I'm down about 32.75 points, unrealized PnL -163.1.\n\n- Invalidation condition: if price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is 3968.35, which is above 3750, so not invalidated.\n\n- RSI is low at 29.468, but MACD is negative, EMA is above current price, but not by much. Funding is positive but small.\n\n- Justification for holding: The position is still within my risk parameters, invalidation not hit. I should hold unless something changes.\n\n- Signal: hold, with full quantity.\n\nNext, SOL:\n\n- Quantity 124.64, entry 192.8, current 192.65, almost flat, PnL -19.08.\n\n- Invalidation: if price closes below 180 on a 3-minute candle. Current 192.65 > 180, not hit.\n\n- RSI 26.769, low, MACD negative, EMA 194.279 vs price 192.65, slight bearish.\n\n- Funding positive, small.\n\n- No reason to close, so hold.\n\nXRP:\n\n- Quantity 3609, entry 2.44, current 2.59315, up, PnL +535.4.\n\n- Invalidation: if price closes below 2.30. Current 2.59315 > 2.30, not hit.\n\n- RSI 32.891, MACD negative but small, EMA 2.613 vs price 2.59315, close.\n\n- Funding positive.\n\n- Still profitable, invalidation not hit, so hold.\n\nBTC:\n\n- Quantity 0.12, entry 107343, current 112636.5, up, PnL +635.22.\n\n- Invalidation: if price closes below 105000. Current 112636.5 > 105000, not hit.\n\n- RSI 39.024, MACD negative but improving, EMA 113027.313 vs price 112636.5, price below EMA.\n\n- Funding positive.\n\n- Still good, hold.\n\nDOGE:\n\n- Quantity 27858, entry 0.18, current 0.192535, up, PnL +221.78.\n\n- Invalidation: if price closes below 0.180. Current 0.192535 > 0.180, not hit.\n\n- RSI 31.621, MACD negative, EMA 0.195 vs price 0.192535, close.\n\n- Funding negative but small.\n\n- Hold.\n\nNow, for coins I'm not in: BNB. I'm not in BNB, so I could consider entering a trade.\n\nLook at BNB data:\n\n- Current price 1080.3, EMA20 1110.745, so price below EMA.\n\n- MACD -11.194, negative.\n\n- RSI 13.824, extremely oversold.\n\n- Funding negative -3.98783e-05, which is negative funding, might indicate short bias, but for entering, could be a buying opportunity if I think it's oversold.\n\n- Open interest latest 68966.39, average 69212.08, slightly down.\n\n- Longer-term: 4-hour EMA20 1132.77 vs EMA50 1125.9, EMA20 above EMA50 but price below both.\n\n- RSI 4-hour 49.06, not extreme.\n\n- ATR 14-period 9.683, current price 1080.3, so volatility is about 0.9%.\n\n- Confidence: RSI is very low at 13.824 on 7-period, which is extremely oversold. This could be a good long entry if I expect a bounce.\n\n- But I need to check if the expected move exceeds trading costs. Trading costs round-trip 0.09%, plus slippage and funding.\n\n- Funding is negative, so if I go long, I might pay funding, but it's small.\n\n- I need to size the trade.\n\nAvailable cash is 9941.45.\n\nFor a new trade, I need to decide margin, leverage, risk_usd, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation.\n\nConfidence: RSI is very oversold, but the trend might still be down. EMA is above price, MACD negative. However, extreme oversold conditions can lead to bounces.\n\nI'd say confidence is moderate, maybe 0.65, since RSI is below 15, which is rare.\n\nConfidence table: 0.60–0.70 → 10–20% of available cash.\n\nAvailable cash 9941.45, so margin could be between 994.145 and 1988.29.\n\nI'll choose margin around 15% of available cash, say 1500 USD.\n\nRisk_usd: fraction of margin, r between 0.2 and 0.8. I'll choose r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 1500 = 750 USD.\n\nLeverage: for BNB, max leverage is 10x, so I'll use 10x for capital efficiency.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 1500 * 10 = 15000 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price. Entry price is current price 1080.3, so quantity = 15000 / 1080.3 ≈ 13.88 (I'll calculate precisely).\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 750 / 13.88 ≈ 54.04 (but need exact).\n\nFirst, set entry price to current: 1080.3\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 15000 / 1080.3 ≈ 13.883\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 750 / 13.883 ≈ 54.02\n\nFor long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 1080.3 - 54.02 = 1026.28\n\nProfit_target: should be a multiple of stop_distance. Typically, risk-reward ratio at least 2:1 or 3:1.\n\nStop_distance is about 54, so profit target could be entry_price + 2*stop_distance or more.\n\nLet's say I aim for 3:1 reward, so profit_distance = 3 * 54.02 ≈ 162.06\n\nProfit_target = entry_price + profit_distance = 1080.3 + 162.06 = 1242.36\n\nBut need to check if realistic. EMA20 is 1110.745, which is above, but 4-hour EMA20 is 1132.77, so 1242 might be high. Perhaps 2:1 or adjust.\n\nATR 14-period is 9.683, but that's for 4-hour, not sure. Intraday volatility.\n\nFrom the price series, prices are around 1100, moving down to 1080.\n\nPerhaps a more conservative target. Since RSI is oversold, I might expect a bounce to EMA20 or something.\n\nEMA20 is 1110.745, which is about 30 points above, stop_distance is 54, so profit to EMA20 is only about 30, which is less than stop_distance, so not good for risk-reward.\n\nI need a target that is at least 2*stop_distance away.\n\nStop_distance is 54, so min profit_distance 108.\n\nEntry 1080.3, so profit_target at least 1188.3.\n\nEMA20 is 1110.7, which is close, 30.4 away, less than 108.\n\n4-hour EMA20 is 1132.77, which is 52.47 away, still less than 108.\n\nNot good. Perhaps I need a smaller risk or larger leverage, but leverage is max 10x for BNB.\n\nIf I use higher leverage, but max is 10x, I can't.\n\nMargin is fixed, notional fixed for given leverage.\n\nPerhaps I need to accept a lower risk-reward or not enter.\n\nRisk_usd is 750, stop_distance 54, but the move I expect might not be large.\n\nRSI is very oversold, so a bounce could be sharp, but I need to quantify.\n\nPerhaps set profit_target based on resistance or something.\n\nFrom longer-term, RSI was higher, but now low.\n\nMaybe I should not enter if the expected move doesn't cover costs.\n\nTrading costs: fees 0.09% round-trip, so for notional 15000, fees about 13.5 USD, plus slippage, say 20 USD total costs? Funding negative, so if long, I pay funding, but small.\n\nRisk_usd is 750, so costs are small compared to risk.\n\nBut the profit needs to be enough.\n\nPerhaps set profit_target to a reasonable level, say 1150 or something.\n\nCalculate stop_distance first.\n\nStop_loss: I can set based on support or ATR.\n\nATR 14-period on 4-hour is 9.683, but that's for 4-hour candles, not intraday.\n\nIntraday, the price moved from 1118 to 1080 in 10 intervals, about 38 points drop, so volatility is high.\n\nI could use ATR for stop.\n\nBut I have risk_usd defined, so stop_distance is fixed by risk_usd and quantity.\n\nQuantity is derived from notional and price.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage.\n\nI set margin=1500, leverage=10, notional=15000, quantity=15000/1080.3≈13.883\n\nrisk_usd=750\n\nstop_distance=750/13.883≈54.02\n\nstop_loss=1080.3-54.02=1026.28\n\nNow, profit_target: I need to set it so that the reward is at least 2 times risk, so profit_distance at least 108.04, so profit_target at least 1080.3+108.04=1188.34\n\nIs 1188 realistic? Current price 1080, EMA20 1110, 4-hour EMA20 1132, so it might reach there if bounces.\n\nRSI oversold, so possible.\n\nInvalidation_condition: for long, if price breaks below a key level, say if it closes below 1000 or something, but my stop_loss is at 1026, so invalidation might be if something else happens, like if RSI stays low or MACD turns worse.\n\nI can set invalidation to if price closes below 1000 on 3-minute candle, but that's below stop_loss, so not necessary. Invalidation is for early exit, outside of stop.\n\nPerhaps if the bounce doesn't happen and price consolidates low.\n\nBut I'll keep it simple.\n\nConfidence: I'll say 0.65 for the oversold condition.\n\nJustification: BNB is extremely oversold with RSI at 13.8, suggesting a potential bounce. Funding is slightly negative, but the oversold condition might lead to a sharp reversal. I expect a move towards EMA around 1110 or higher, with profit target at 1188 to achieve a 2:1 risk-reward ratio.\n\nNow, for other coins, I'm already in positions, so I hold.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin I act on or have position.\n\nFor ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, I hold.\n\nFor BNB, I enter long.\n\nBut I must ensure that for hold, I output the same values as in the position, but I need to provide the current stop_loss, profit_target, etc., from the exit_plan.\n\nIn the output for hold, I need to include all fields: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nFrom the account info, for each position, I have those values.\n\nFor example, for ETH: quantity 4.98, profit_target 4601.6675, stop_loss 3801.3775, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 1000.0\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI should use the same values for hold.\n\nNow, for BNB entry.\n\nSignal: buy_to_enter\n\nQuantity: as calculated, 15000 / 1080.3 = let's compute exactly.\n\n1080.3 * quantity = notional = 15000, so quantity = 15000 / 1080.3 ≈ 13.883, but since it's quantity, probably need to round to appropriate decimals, but for crypto, it might be fine to use float.\n\nIn the output, quantity is float.\n\nProfit_target: I set to 1188.34, but let's make it neat, say 1188.3\n\nStop_loss: 1026.28\n\nInvalidation_condition: I'll say \"If the price fails to bounce and closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\" or something. But to be quantifiable, \"If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nLeverage: 10\n\nConfidence: 0.65\n\nRisk_usd: 750\n\nJustification: as above.\n\nNow, available cash is 9941.45, margin I'm using 1500, which is about 15%, within 10-20%, so ok.\n\nrisk_usd 750, margin 1500, r=0.5, within [0.2,0.8], ok.\n\nLeverage 10, max for BNB is 10, so ok.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide JSON for each coin.\n\nCoins I have positions: ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE → hold\n\nBNB → buy_to_enter\n\nI don't have other coins, so only these.\n\nIn the output, I need to have a JSON object for each coin I'm acting on or holding.\n\nSo, for ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, output hold with their current exit plan values.\n\nFor BNB, output buy_to_enter with new values.\n\nNow, for the hold signals, I must use the quantity from the position, which is given.\n\nFor example, ETH quantity 4.98, etc.\n\nSimilarly, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition from exit_plan.\n\nLeverage, confidence, risk_usd from the position data.\n\nIn the account info, for each position, I have those.\n\nFor example, for ETH: \"quantity\": 4.98, \"profit_target\": 4601.6675, \"stop_loss\": 3801.3775, \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle\", \"leverage\": 10, \"confidence\": 0.65, \"risk_usd\": 1000.0\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI should use exactly those values for hold.\n\nFor BNB, new entry.\n\nNow, compute quantity precisely.\n\nEntry price: current_price = 1080.3\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 1500 * 10 = 15000\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 15000 / 1080.3 = 13.883000000000001 (approximately, but in code, it might be fine)\n\nI can use 13.883\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 750 / 13.883 ≈ 54.016\n\nStop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 1080.3 - 54.016 = 1026.284\n\nProfit_target, I want at least 2:1, so profit_distance = 2 * stop_distance = 108.032, so profit_target = 1080.3 + 108.032 = 1188.332\n\nI can round to 1188.33 or something.\n\nBut to be precise, I'll use calculated values.\n\nInvalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nConfidence: 0.65\n\nRisk_usd: 750\n\nJustification: \"BNB RSI is extremely oversold at 13.8, indicating a high probability of a bounce. I expect a move towards the EMA around 1110 or higher, with a profit target set for a 2:1 risk-reward ratio.\"\n\nNow, for the output JSON.\n\nI need to output a single JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nLike {\"ETH\": { ... }, \"SOL\": { ... }, ... }\n\nAnd for each, the trade_signal_args.\n\nFirst, for holds.\n\nLet me list the values from account info.\n\nETH: \n- coin: ETH\n- signal: hold\n- quantity: 4.98\n- profit_target: 4601.6675\n- stop_loss: 3801.3775\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 1000.0\n\nBut in the output for hold, I don't need justification, right? Look at the example for hold:\n\n\"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n\t  \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n\t  \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n\nNo justification for hold, only for entry and close.\n\nSimilarly for close, there is justification.\n\nFor hold, no justification.\n\nIn the input, for each position, there is exit_plan with profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation, and separately confidence, risk_usd, etc.\n\nI should use those.\n\nSimilarly for SOL:\n- quantity: 124.64\n- profit_target: 211.985\n- stop_loss: 183.08\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 180 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.7\n- risk_usd: 1203.832\n\nXRP:\n- quantity: 3609.0\n- profit_target: 2.815\n- stop_loss: 2.325\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 442.032\n\nBTC:\n- quantity: 0.12\n- profit_target: 118136.15\n- stop_loss: 102026.675\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.75\n- risk_usd: 619.2345\n\nDOGE:\n- quantity: 27858.0\n- profit_target: 0.212275\n- stop_loss: 0.175355\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 257.13\n\nFor BNB, new entry.\n\nSignal: buy_to_enter\nQuantity: 15000 / 1080.3 = let's calculate exactly.\n\n1080.3 * quantity = 15000, so quantity = 15000 / 1080.3 = 15000 / 1080.3\n\nCompute: 1080.3 * 13.883 = 1080.3 * 13 = 14043.9, 1080.3 * 0.883 = approximately 954.1049, total 14998.0049, close to 15000, so quantity ≈ 13.883\n\nI'll use quantity = 13.883\n\nProfit_target: 1188.332 (as above)\n\nStop_loss: 1026.284\n\nInvalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nLeverage: 10\n\nConfidence: 0.65\n\nRisk_usd: 750\n\nJustification: \"BNB is extremely oversold with RSI at 13.8, suggesting a high probability of a bounce. Funding is slightly negative but the oversold condition may lead to a sharp reversal towards EMA around 1110 or higher, with profit target set for a 2:1 risk-reward ratio.\"\n\nNow, for the output JSON.\n\nI need to output one JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, for ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, hold with their values.\n\nFor BNB, buy_to_enter.\n\nIn the output, the coin key should be the symbol, like \"ETH\", etc.\n\nAnd the value is another object with \"trade_signal_args\".\n\nSo, the overall output should be a JSON object like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.98,\n      \"profit_target\": 4601.6675,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3801.3775,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1000.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 124.64,\n      \"profit_target\": 211.985,\n      \"stop_loss\": 183.08,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 180 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1203.832\n    }\n  },\n  ... similarly for XRP, BTC, DOGE,\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"justification\": \"BNB is extremely oversold with RSI at 13.8, suggesting a high probability of a bounce.

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. I must decide for each coin whether to hold or close the position based on the invalidation condition or other factors. I can only take one action per coin: hold or close. For coins I'm flat, I can consider entering, but I need to be disciplined and only enter if the expected move exceeds trading costs significantly.\n\nAvailable cash is $9415.57. When entering a new trade, I need to size it properly using the confidence table. But since I'm already in multiple positions, I should be cautious about adding new ones unless there's a very good opportunity. The instructions say: \"No pyramiding or size increases.\" So if I'm already in a position for a coin, I can't enter another; I can only hold or close.\n\nReviewing existing positions:\n\n1. **SOL**: Quantity 124.64, entry price 192.8, current price 187.005, unrealized PnL -722.68. Exit plan: profit target 211.985, stop loss 183.08, invalidation condition: price closes below 180 on 3-minute candle. Current price is above stop loss and invalidation. RSI is low at 18.752, which is oversold, but MACD is negative. I should hold unless invalidation triggers. No invalidation yet.\n\n2. **XRP**: Quantity 3609.0, entry price 2.44, current price 2.49695, unrealized PnL +188.21. Exit plan: profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325, invalidation: price closes below 2.30. Current price is above stop loss and invalidation. RSI is 14.787, very oversold. Might be a buying opportunity, but I'm already long. Should hold.\n\n3. **BTC**: Quantity 0.12, entry price 107343.0, current price 108464.5, unrealized PnL +134.58. Exit plan: profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation: price closes below 105000. Current price is well above stop loss and invalidation. RSI is 16.739, oversold. MACD negative. Hold.\n\n4. **DOGE**: Quantity 27858.0, entry price 0.18, current price 0.18356, unrealized PnL -28.25. Exit plan: profit target 0.212275, stop loss 0.175355, invalidation: price closes below 0.180. Current price is above stop loss but close to invalidation. Invalidation is below 0.180, and current is 0.18356, so it's above. RSI is 18.721, oversold. Hold.\n\n5. **BNB**: Quantity 13.76, entry price 1084.99, current price 1095.4, unrealized PnL +143.21. Exit plan: profit target 1188.332, stop loss 1026.284, invalidation: price closes below 1000. Current price is above stop loss and invalidation. RSI is 22.249, a bit oversold. Hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered. All positions are still valid based on their plans. So for all existing positions, I should signal 'hold'.\n\nNow, for coins I'm flat: I'm not in ETH. So I should consider if I want to enter ETH.\n\nCheck ETH data: current price 3808.75, EMA20 3849.243, price below EMA, MACD negative -18.163, RSI 7-period is 10.874, which is extremely oversold. RSI 14-period is 15.629, also very oversold. Funding rate is positive but small. Open interest is high but not extreme.\n\nThis looks like a potential buying opportunity because RSI is so low, indicating oversold conditions. However, I need to be cautious because the trend might still be down. MACD is negative, but perhaps a bounce is due.\n\nI need to decide if I should enter. Confidence: RSI below 10 is very rare, so confidence might be high. Suggested confidence range: if 0.70-0.85, margin 20-40% of available cash. Available cash is 9415.57. 20% is about 1883, 40% is 3766. But I should not over-leverage since I have other positions.\n\nI need to calculate the entry parameters if I enter.\n\nAction for ETH: consider 'buy_to_enter' since it's oversold.\n\nFor other coins I'm flat, but I'm already in five positions, so maybe I should not add more unless very confident. The instructions say \"discover alpha\", but I need to avoid over-trading. ETH seems the most oversold with RSI below 11.\n\nCheck other coins: all have low RSI, but ETH has the lowest RSI at 10.874. SOL is 18.75, XRP 14.78, BTC 16.73, BNB 22.24, DOGE 18.72. ETH is the most oversold.\n\nPerhaps I should enter a long position in ETH.\n\nNow, for entry, I need to determine:\n\n- confidence: based on RSI extreme, I'd say confidence is high. Let's say 0.80 (since RSI < 11 is very oversold, but need to see if trend is reversing). MACD is still negative, so not perfect. Maybe confidence 0.75.\n\nConfidence table: 0.70-0.85 → 20-40% margin. I'll choose confidence 0.75.\n\nThen margin: say 30% of available cash? Available cash 9415.57, 30% is 2824.671. But I need to ensure margin is at least 5% of available cash, which is 470.78, so 2824 is fine.\n\nRisk_usd: fraction of margin, r between 0.2 and 0.8. Say r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 2824.671 = 1412.3355. But risk_usd must be less than margin, which it is.\n\nLeverage: for ETH, max leverage is 25x. I should use at least 5x. Since confidence is high, I might use higher leverage for efficiency. Say leverage=15x? But I need to calculate stop loss and all.\n\nFirst, notional = margin * leverage. If margin=2824.67, leverage=15, notional=42370.05.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 42370.05 / 3808.75 ≈ 11.12 (since ETH price is 3808.75, so quantity should be in units of ETH? No, quantity is the number of contracts, but since it's perp, it's like the size. In the examples, for BTC, quantity is 0.12, which is small because BTC price is high. Similarly, for ETH, quantity should be notional / price.\n\nEntry price: 3808.75\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 42370.05 / 3808.75 ≈ 11.12 ETH? But in the position details, for BTC, quantity is 0.12 for notional 13015.74, which is about 0.12 * 108464.5 ≈ 13015.74, yes. So quantity is the number of coins.\n\nSo for ETH, quantity = notional / price.\n\nBut I need to set profit_target and stop_loss.\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity\n\nFirst, I have risk_usd = 1412.34\n\nQuantity = notional / price = (margin * leverage) / price\n\nBut I need to set leverage first.\n\nI should decide leverage. Min leverage 5x, max 25x for ETH. I'll choose leverage=10x to be consistent with other positions.\n\nSo leverage=10.\n\nThen notional = margin * 10\n\nBut margin I haven't fixed yet. I need to choose margin based on confidence.\n\nConfidence 0.75, so margin between 20-40% of available cash. Available cash=9415.57, so min margin for confidence is 20% of 9415.57 = 1883.114, max 40% = 3766.228.\n\nI should choose a margin amount. Say I choose margin=2500 (about 26.5% of available cash, within range).\n\nThen risk_usd = r * margin, with r=0.5, so risk_usd=1250.\n\nThen notional = margin * leverage = 2500 * 10 = 25000 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 25000 / 3808.75 ≈ 6.564 ETH? Let's calculate exactly.\n\n3808.75 * 6.564 ≈ 25000? 3808.75 * 6.564 = let's compute: 3808.75 * 6 = 22852.5, 3808.75 * 0.564 ≈ 2148.135, total 25000.635, close enough.\n\nBut quantity should be precise.\n\nPerhaps I should set quantity based on the calculation.\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 1250 / 6.564 ≈ 190.43 USD per ETH? Stop distance in price terms.\n\nFor long position, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 3808.75 - 190.43 ≈ 3618.32\n\nProfit_target: I need to set it such that it's a multiple of stop_distance. Typically, risk-reward ratio, say 2:1 or 3:1. I should aim for at least 2:1 to cover costs.\n\nSo if stop_distance is 190.43, profit distance should be at least 2*190.43=380.86, so profit_target = entry_price + profit_distance = 3808.75 + 380.86 = 4189.61\n\nBut I need to make it realistic. Also, consider resistance levels? I don't have more data, but from EMA, EMA20 is 3849.24, which is above current price, so if price moves up, it might test EMA.\n\nBut profit target should be beyond that. Perhaps set profit target at a level where RSI might become overbought, but I don't have that.\n\nI can set based on ATR or something. 4-hour ATR for ETH is 34.451, so profit distance of 380 is about 11 ATR, which might be too far. 3-period ATR is 35.584, similar.\n\nPerhaps a smaller multiple. Since RSI is very oversold, a bounce could be sharp. But I need to be conservative.\n\nMaybe set profit target at EMA20 or higher. EMA20 is 3849.24, which is only about 40 points above, while stop distance is 190, so profit distance should be larger for good risk-reward.\n\nStop distance is 190, so for 2:1, profit distance 380, target 3808.75+380=4188.75, which is above EMA20.\n\nPerhaps 3:1, but might be too far.\n\nI should aim for a risk-reward of at least 2:1.\n\nInvalidation_condition: for a long entry, invalidation might be if price breaks below a key level. Since I'm buying oversold, invalidation could be if RSI recovers but then price falls below entry or something. But I need a specific condition. Perhaps if price closes below the recent low or below stop loss, but stop loss is already set.\n\nInvalidation condition is additional to stop loss. It should be a rare event that invalidates the thesis. For example, if price breaks below a significant support.\n\nFrom the data, the low prices: looking at intraday series, the mid prices for ETH: last few are 3824.35, 3815.8, 3812.8, 3808.75, so current is 3808.75, which might be the low. So invalidation could be if price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle, but that's close to stop loss? Stop loss is at 3618.32, which is lower.\n\nPerhaps invalidation should be something like if the EMA20 starts rising or something, but I need a price level.\n\nPerhaps set invalidation to if price closes below the recent low, say below 3800, but that might be too tight.\n\nAnother idea: invalidation if the RSI fails to rise above 30 within a certain time, but I need a price-based condition.\n\nI can set invalidation condition as: \"If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle\" or something, but that's below stop loss? Stop loss is at 3618, so 3750 is above stop loss. Invalidation should trigger before stop loss or after? Invalidation is for the thesis, so it might be a different level.\n\nIn the existing positions, invalidation is set at levels above stop loss. For example, for BTC, stop loss 102026, invalidation below 105000. So invalidation is a earlier warning.\n\nSimilarly, for ETH, I can set invalidation at a level where if price breaks, the oversold bounce thesis is invalid. Perhaps if price closes below 3780 or something.\n\nLooking at prices, the lows are around 3808, so perhaps set invalidation at 3800.\n\nBut let's see the 4-hour context: 20-period EMA is 3990, which is far above, so downward momentum might be strong.\n\nI need to be cautious. Perhaps confidence is not that high because trend is down.\n\nRSI is very oversold, so probability of bounce is high, but magnitude might be small.\n\nI should check if there's divergence or something, but I don't have more indicators.\n\nPerhaps I should not enter ETH because I'm already in five positions, and adding another might over-diversify or increase risk.\n\nThe instructions say \"discover alpha\", and ETH seems to have alpha due to extreme oversold condition.\n\nBut let's see if there are better opportunities. Other coins are also oversold, but I'm already long in them, so for ETH, I'm flat, so it's a new opportunity.\n\nI think I should enter ETH long.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to output for each coin I act on. For existing positions, I need to output 'hold' for each. And for ETH, if I enter, output 'buy_to_enter'.\n\nSo I need to create JSON objects for SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB with 'hold', and for ETH with 'buy_to_enter'.\n\nBut the output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nThe example shows: { \"COIN\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } } }\n\nSo I need to have a top-level object with keys for each coin I'm acting on, which includes all coins I have positions in and any new entry.\n\nSo for this invocation, I will have entries for SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB (all hold), and ETH (buy_to_enter).\n\nNow, for the hold signals, I need to provide the same fields: justification is only for entry or close, for hold, no justification needed, just the plan.\n\nIn the hold example, there is no \"justification\" key. Look back:\n\nFor hold: \n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification for hold.\n\nFor entry and close, there is justification.\n\nSo for hold, I just need to copy the existing exit plan values from the account information.\n\nSimilarly, for close, but I'm not closing any.\n\nFor ETH entry, I need to compute all parameters.\n\nFirst, decide for ETH:\n\nConfidence: I'll set confidence=0.75\n\nMargin: I need to choose a margin amount. Available cash=9415.57. Confidence 0.75 suggests margin 20-40%. I'll choose margin=2500 USD (about 26.5%).\n\nLeverage: for ETH, max 25x, min 5x. I'll use leverage=10x to be consistent with other positions.\n\nRisk_usd: I'll set r=0.5, so risk_usd=0.5 * 2500 = 1250 USD.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 2500 * 10 = 25000 USD.\n\nEntry_price = 3808.75\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 25000 / 3808.75 ≈ 6.564 (let's calculate exactly: 25000 / 3808.75 = ? 3808.75 * 6.564 = 3808.75 * 6 = 22852.5, 3808.75 * 0.564 = 2148.135, total 25000.635, so quantity ≈ 6.564, but I need to use precise value. Since price is given, I can compute quantity exactly.\n\n25000 / 3808.75 = 25000 / 3808.75 = let's divide: 3808.75 * 6.56 = 3808.75*6=22852.5, 3808.75*0.56=2132.9, total 24985.4, close to 25000, difference 14.6, so quantity ≈ 6.5643, but I should use the exact fraction.\n\nIn programming, it would be calculated, but since I'm outputting, I can use a float. Let's compute exactly: quantity = 25000 / 3808.75 = 25000 / (3808.75) = simplify? 3808.75 = 15235/4? Better to use decimal.\n\n3808.75 = 3808.75, so quantity = 25000 / 3808.75 = 6.564327 (approximately). I'll use 6.564 for simplicity, but in JSON, I can use a float.\n\nIn the existing positions, quantities are given with decimals, like 124.64 for SOL, so I can use similar precision.\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 1250 / 6.564 ≈ 190.43\n\nFor long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 3808.75 - 190.43 = 3618.32\n\nProfit_target: I need to set a multiple. Say risk-reward ratio 2:1, so profit_distance = 2 * stop_distance = 380.86, so profit_target = 3808.75 + 380.86 = 4189.61\n\nBut let's make it neat. Perhaps round to reasonable digits. Prices are given with two decimals for ETH? In data, ETH price is 3808.75, so two decimals. Stop loss and profit target should similar.\n\nStop_loss = 3618.32, profit_target=4189.61\n\nInvalidation_condition: I need a string. Perhaps \"If the price closes below 3780 on a 3-minute candle\" or something. Since current price is 3808.75, and lows are around there, perhaps set at 3800? But 3800 is only 8.75 below, which is less than stop distance. Stop distance is 190, so invalidation should be closer to entry? In existing positions, for BTC, invalidation is below 105000, stop loss 102026, difference about 2974, while entry 107343, so invalidation is about 2343 below entry, stop loss 5317 below entry. So invalidation is closer to entry than stop loss.\n\nSimilarly, for SOL, entry 192.8, stop loss 183.08, difference 9.72, invalidation below 180, difference 12.8 from entry, so invalidation is below stop loss? 180 is below 183.08? 180 < 183.08, so invalidation is lower than stop loss? That doesn't make sense because invalidation should trigger before stop loss? Let's check.\n\nFor SOL: entry 192.8, stop loss 183.08, invalidation: price closes below 180. So 180 is below 183.08, so if price closes below 180, it would have already hit stop loss at 183.08? That seems inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps I misread. Stop loss for SOL is 183.08, which is below entry, for long position, stop loss is below entry. Invalidation is below 180, which is even lower, so if price falls, it hits stop loss at 183.08 before invalidation at 180. But invalidation condition might be for other reasons, but in this case, it's price-based, so it might be redundant.\n\nIn the account info, for SOL: \"invalidation_condition\": 'If the price closes below 180 on a 3-minute candle', and stop_loss=183.08. So indeed, invalidation is set below stop loss, which means if price closes below 180, it might trigger after stop loss is hit? But stop loss should be executed when price hits 183.08, so invalidation at 180 might not be hit if stop loss closes the position.\n\nPerhaps the invalidation condition is for manual override or something. But in the context, it might be that invalidation is a condition that, if true, we close the position regardless, but it should be set above stop loss for longs to exit early.\n\nIn standard trading, invalidation is often set where the thesis is broken, which might be before stop loss.\n\nFor example, if I'm buying a pullback to support, invalidation might be if support breaks, which is where stop loss is set. But sometimes invalidation is a different level.\n\nIn the given examples, for BTC, invalidation below 105000, stop loss 102026, so invalidation is above stop loss? 105000 > 102026, so for long position, if price falls below 105000, it triggers invalidation, but stop loss is at 102026, so invalidation triggers at higher price, meaning we exit early if thesis is invalidated before stop loss.\n\nThat makes sense. Similarly, for SOL, invalidation below 180, but stop loss is 183.08, so 180 < 183.08, so invalidation is lower, which means we only invalidate after price falls below stop loss? That seems wrong.\n\nLet's check SOL numbers: entry 192.8, stop loss 183.08, so stop loss is about 9.72 below entry. Invalidation below 180, which is 12.8 below entry, so indeed, invalidation is lower than stop loss. But if price falls, it hits stop loss at 183.08 first, so the position would be closed at stop loss before reaching invalidation. So the invalidation condition might never trigger because stop loss hits first.\n\nThat might be a mistake in the example, or perhaps for SOL, the invalidation is meant to be above stop loss.\n\nLook at other coins: for XRP, entry 2.44, stop loss 2.325, invalidation below 2.30. 2.30 < 2.325, so again, invalidation below stop loss.\n\nFor DOGE, entry 0.18, stop loss 0.175355, invalidation below 0.180? Invalidation is below 0.180, and entry is 0.18, so invalidation is at entry? \"invalidation_condition\": 'If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle', and entry is 0.18, so if price closes below entry, it triggers invalidation, while stop loss is at 0.175355, which is lower. So invalidation triggers before stop loss, which is correct for exiting early if thesis broken.\n\nSimilarly, for BNB, entry 1084.99, stop loss 1026.284, invalidation below 1000, so invalidation below stop loss? 1000 < 1026.284, so invalidation lower.\n\nFor BTC, invalidation below 105000, stop loss 102026, so invalidation above stop loss? 105000 > 102026, so for long, invalidation is at higher price, meaning we exit if price falls below 105000, before stop loss at 102026.\n\nInconsistency: for BTC, invalidation is above stop loss (105000 > 102026), for others, invalidation is below stop loss.\n\nFor DOGE, invalidation below 0.180, stop loss 0.175355, so invalidation above stop loss? 0.180 > 0.175355, yes, so for DOGE, invalidation is at higher price than stop loss.\n\nSimilarly, for XRP, invalidation below 2.30, stop loss 2.325, so 2.30 < 2.325, so invalidation below stop loss.\n\nFor SOL, invalidation below 180, stop loss 183.08, so 180 < 183.08, invalidation below stop loss.\n\nFor BNB, invalidation below 1000, stop loss 1026.284, so 1000 < 1026.284, invalidation below stop loss.\n\nOnly for BTC, invalidation is above stop loss.\n\nPerhaps it's coin-specific. But generally, invalidation should be set where the thesis is broken, which for longs, if price falls below a support level, it might be above or below stop loss.\n\nIn this case, for consistency, I should set invalidation for ETH at a level where if price breaks, the oversold bounce thesis is invalid. Since current price is low, and EMA is above, perhaps if price fails to rise above EMA20 or something, but I need a price level.\n\nPerhaps set invalidation if price closes below 3780, which is about 28 points below entry, while stop loss is 190 below, so invalidation is closer to entry.\n\nI'll set invalidation_condition for ETH: \"If the price closes below 3780 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nNow, for profit_target, I set 4189.61, but let's round it to 4190 or keep as is.\n\nI need to justify the entry for ETH.\n\nJustification: \"ETH RSI is extremely oversold at 10.874, indicating a potential bounce. Despite negative MACD, the oversold condition suggests high probability of short-term recovery. I expect a move towards the EMA20 at 3849 or higher, exceeding trading costs.\"\n\nConfidence: 0.75\n\nRisk_usd: 1250\n\nLeverage: 10\n\nQuantity: compute exactly. entry_price=3808.75, notional=25000, so quantity=25000 / 3808.75 = 6.564327... I'll use 6.564\n\nBut in JSON, I can use a float with enough decimals.\n\nSimilarly, stop_loss=3618.32, profit_target=4189.61\n\nNow, for the hold positions, I need to output for each coin with signal 'hold', and provide the existing values from account info.\n\nFor example, for SOL:\nquantity=124.64\nprofit_target=211.985\nstop_loss=183.08\ninvalidation_condition='If the price closes below 180 on a 3-minute candle'\nleverage=10\nconfidence=0.7\nrisk_usd=1203.832\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNote: for hold, no justification needed.\n\nNow, for the output, I need a JSON object with keys for each coin: SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, and ETH.\n\nSo the top-level object will have six keys.\n\nI need to make sure the quantities are correct for hold: use the full current size from account info.\n\nFor ETH, use the calculated values.\n\nFinally, output only JSON, no prose.\n\nSo let's compile.",

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. For each, I must decide whether to 'hold' or 'close_position'. Only if the invalidation condition is met, I should close; otherwise, hold.\n\nLet's go through each coin:\n\n- **ETH**: Current price is 3819.15, entry price is 3812.3, so I'm up slightly. Invalidation condition is if price closes below 3780 on a 3-minute candle. The current price is above that, and it's not closing below 3780 right now. So, I should hold.\n\n- **SOL**: Current price is 188.005, entry price is 192.8, so I'm down. Invalidation condition is if price closes below 180 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is 188, which is above 180, so not invalidated. I should hold.\n\n- **XRP**: Current price is 2.49985, entry price is 2.44, up. Invalidation condition is if price closes below 2.30. Current price is above, so hold.\n\n- **BTC**: Current price is 108445.5, entry price is 107343.0, up. Invalidation condition is if price closes below 105000. Current price is above, so hold.\n\n- **DOGE**: Current price is 0.18425, entry price is 0.18, slightly up. Invalidation condition is if price closes below 0.180. Current price is 0.18425, which is above 0.180, so not invalidated. I should hold.\n\n- **BNB**: Current price is 1100.05, entry price is 1084.99, up. Invalidation condition is if price closes below 1000. Current price is above, so hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered, so for all existing positions, I should signal 'hold'.\n\nNow, I need to check if I want to enter any new trades. I'm already in all six coins, and the system says \"tradable tokens: ['ETH','SOL','XRP','BTC','DOGE','BNB']\", so I'm maxed out on positions. I can't enter a new position in a coin I'm already in, because that would be pyramiding, which is not allowed. The instructions say: \"No pyramiding or size increases. If you see a big opportunity, size it correctly on entry, because you won't be able to scale up your position on that name.\"\n\nSince I'm already in all coins, I shouldn't be entering any new positions. I should only manage existing ones.\n\nFor each coin, I need to output a JSON object with the 'hold' signal, and include all the required fields: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI have the current quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, etc., from the account information. For 'hold', I need to use the full current size, which is given as 'quantity' in the position details.\n\nLet's list out the current values for each:\n\nFrom account positions:\n\n- ETH: quantity=6.58, profit_target=4189.61, stop_loss=3618.32, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 3780 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.75, risk_usd=1250.0\n\n- SOL: quantity=124.64, profit_target=211.985, stop_loss=183.08, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 180 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.7, risk_usd=1203.832\n\n- XRP: quantity=3609.0, profit_target=2.815, stop_loss=2.325, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=442.032\n\n- BTC: quantity=0.12, profit_target=118136.15, stop_loss=102026.675, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.75, risk_usd=619.2345\n\n- DOGE: quantity=27858.0, profit_target=0.212275, stop_loss=0.175355, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=257.13\n\n- BNB: quantity=13.76, profit_target=1188.332, stop_loss=1026.284, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=750.0\n\nFor 'hold', I don't need to change these values; I just need to output them as is.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object for each coin with the 'hold' signal.\n\nAlso, for 'hold', the justification is not required in the JSON; only for entry and close. Looking back at the instructions:\n\n- For hold: the JSON does not include a 'justification' field. It's only for entry and close.\n\nIn the hold example: \n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification. So for hold, I omit justification.\n\nFor entry and close, I need justification, but for hold, not.\n\nSince I'm holding all, I'll output for each coin.\n\nNow, is there any reason to close a position? The invalidation conditions are not met, and I should not close unless invalidated. The behavioral guardrails say: \"Do not close a position early unless your invalidation triggers.\"\n\nSo, all good.\n\nFinally, output the JSON.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON is compact and for each coin.\n\nAlso, the signal must be exactly as specified.\n\nSo, for each coin, I'll output the hold signal with the current parameters.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm currently holding all my positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB as none of their invalidation conditions have been met, and I'm already fully invested across these assets. I'm observing positive unrealized gains in ETH, XRP, BTC, and BNB, with SOL and DOGE showing slight losses but still within their current trade parameters."

    "cot_trace": "First, I am considering my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. I need to check if any of them should be closed due to invalidation conditions or if I should hold.\n\nStarting with SOL: I'm long with entry at 192.8, current price is 186.145, which is down. The stop loss is set at 183.08, and the invalidation condition is if the price closes below 180 on a 3-minute candle. Looking at the intraday prices for SOL: [187.04, 186.475, 185.63, 186.06, 186.17, 186.19, 186.435, 186.215, 186.005, 186.145]. None of these are below 180, so the invalidation isn't triggered. The price is above the stop loss of 183.08, so I should hold. Confidence was 0.7, and risk_usd is 1203.832.\n\nFor XRP: I'm long with entry at 2.44, current price is 2.4685, which is up slightly. Stop loss is 2.325, invalidation is if price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle. Intraday prices: [2.485, 2.472, 2.462, 2.465, 2.468, 2.471, 2.476, 2.472, 2.467, 2.4685]. All above 2.30, so no invalidation. Price is above stop loss, so hold. Confidence 0.65, risk_usd 442.032.\n\nFor BTC: I'm long with entry at 107343.0, current price 107923.5, up. Stop loss is 102026.675, invalidation is if price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle. Intraday prices: [108396.5, 108133.0, 107680.0, 107585.0, 107637.0, 107790.5, 108011.0, 107933.5, 107930.0, 107923.5]. All well above 105000, so no invalidation. Price above stop loss, hold. Confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345.\n\nFor DOGE: I'm long with entry at 0.18, current price 0.182285, up slightly. Stop loss is 0.175355, invalidation is if price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle. Intraday prices: [0.183, 0.183, 0.182, 0.182, 0.183, 0.183, 0.183, 0.183, 0.183, 0.182285]. All above 0.180, so no invalidation. Price above stop loss, hold. Confidence 0.65, risk_usd 257.13.\n\nFor BNB: I'm long with entry at 1084.99, current price 1082.75, down slightly. Stop loss is 1026.284, invalidation is if price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle. Intraday prices: [1091.65, 1087.25, 1084.0, 1085.1, 1086.95, 1088.45, 1090.85, 1089.75, 1084.1, 1082.75]. All well above 1000, so no invalidation. Price above stop loss, hold. Confidence 0.65, risk_usd 750.0.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any new opportunities to enter trades. I have available cash of 9115.0, and I should only enter if confidence is high and expected move exceeds trading costs.\n\nLooking at each coin's data:\n\n- BTC: Current price 107923.5, EMA20 at 108209.514, so price below EMA, RSI7 at 41.529, which is oversold but not extremely. MACD negative but improving (from -361.147 to -323.619 in longer-term). Funding positive but small. Not a strong signal.\n\n- ETH: Current price 3774.35, EMA20 at 3804.011, price below EMA, RSI7 at 23.865, which is very oversold. MACD negative but improving slightly. Funding positive. RSI below 30 could indicate a bounce. Confidence might be around 0.7 for a long entry. But I need to calculate if it's worth it.\n\n- SOL: I already have a position, and it's down, but no reason to close. RSI7 at 37.776, not oversold.\n\n- BNB: I have a position, RSI7 at 23.573, very oversold, but I'm already in, so no new entry.\n\n- XRP: I have a position, RSI7 at 35.453, not oversold.\n\n- DOGE: I have a position, RSI7 at 30.666, oversold but not extreme.\n\nETH seems interesting because RSI7 is 23.865, which is deeply oversold, and price is below EMA, suggesting a potential reversal. Funding is positive, which might support a long position.\n\nI should consider entering a long position on ETH.\n\nFirst, determine confidence. RSI below 25 is often a buy signal, but I need more context. EMA20 is above price, but MACD is negative. Longer-term MACD is improving from -30.434 to -18.155? Wait, no, the intraday MACD is provided, and longer-term is 4-hour. Intraday MACD for ETH: [-17.628, -19.025, -19.776, -20.075, -19.578, -19.22, -18.355, -17.459, -17.667, -18.155]. It's fluctuating but not strongly trending up. However, RSI is low, so I'll set confidence at 0.7 for a potential bounce.\n\nFrom confidence table, 0.70–0.85 → 20–40% of available cash. Available cash is 9115, so margin could be between 1823 and 3646. I'll choose margin around 25% of available cash, say 2278.75, but I need to round or something. Actually, I should decide margin based on confidence.\n\nConfidence 0.7, so margin between 20-40% of available cash. Let's say 30%, so margin = 0.3 * 9115 = 2734.5 USD.\n\nRisk_usd should be a fraction of margin, r between 0.2 and 0.8. I'll set r = 0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 2734.5 = 1367.25 USD.\n\nLeverage for ETH: max is 25x, min is 5x. I'll use 10x leverage to start, similar to other positions.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 2734.5 * 10 = 27345 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price. Entry price is current price, 3774.35, so quantity = 27345 / 3774.35 ≈ 7.247 ETH. But I need to make sure it's a reasonable size.\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 1367.25 / 7.247 ≈ 188.57 USD per ETH? No, stop_distance is in price terms.\n\nFor long position, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance.\n\nrisk_usd is the dollar amount risked, so stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = (margin * leverage) / entry_price\n\nSo stop_distance = risk_usd / [ (margin * leverage) / entry_price ] = (risk_usd * entry_price) / (margin * leverage)\n\nBut risk_usd = r * margin, so stop_distance = (r * margin * entry_price) / (margin * leverage) = (r * entry_price) / leverage\n\nThat's simpler. For long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = entry_price - (r * entry_price) / leverage = entry_price * (1 - r / leverage)\n\nSimilarly, for short.\n\nIn this case, r = 0.5, leverage = 10, so stop_distance = (0.5 * 3774.35) / 10 = 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175? No.\n\nstop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage = (0.5 * 3774.35) / 10 = 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175? 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175, but that can't be right because 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175? 1887.175 divided by 10 is 188.7175? No, 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175 is incorrect; 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175? 1887.175 ÷ 10 = 188.7175? Let's calculate: 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175? No, 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175 is wrong. 1887.175 divided by 10 is 188.7175? I think I'm messing up.\n\n1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175? No, 1887.175 ÷ 10 = 188.7175 is not correct. 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175? Let's do it properly: 1887.175 ÷ 10 = 188.7175? No, dividing by 10 moves decimal left, so 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175? 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175? 1887.175 ÷ 10 = 188.7175 is incorrect. 1887.175 ÷ 10 = 188.7175? 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175? I think I have a brain fart.\n\n1887.175 divided by 10 is 188.7175? No, 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175 is wrong. The correct calculation: 1887.175 ÷ 10 = 188.7175? No, 1887.175 ÷ 10 = 188.7175 is not right. Let's think: 1000 / 10 = 100, so 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175? 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175? 1887.175 ÷ 10 = 188.7175? I'm confusing myself.\n\nActually, (r * entry_price) / leverage = (0.5 * 3774.35) / 10 = (1887.175) / 10 = 188.7175? 1887.175 divided by 10 is 188.7175? No, 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175 is incorrect. 1887.175 ÷ 10 = 188.7175? Let's calculate numerically: 1887.175 ÷ 10 = 188.7175? 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175? This is silly. 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175 is wrong because 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175 would mean 1887.175 = 10 * 188.7175 = 1887.175, oh wait, 10 * 188.7175 = 1887.175, yes, so it is correct. 1887.175 / 10 = 188.7175. Okay, so stop_distance = 188.7175.\n\nThen stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 3774.35 - 188.7175 = 3585.6325\n\nBut I need to set a profit target. Profit target should be a multiple of stop_distance. Typically, risk-reward ratio, say 2:1 or 3:1. I'll set reward to risk ratio of 3:1, so profit distance = 3 * stop_distance = 3 * 188.7175 = 566.1525\n\nSo profit_target = entry_price + profit_distance = 3774.35 + 566.1525 = 4340.5025\n\nNow, check if this is realistic. Current EMA20 is 3804.011, so profit target is above that. RSI is low, so bounce could be strong. Funding positive. Seems okay.\n\nInvalidation condition: for a long, if price closes below a key level, say below the recent low. Looking at intraday prices, the lowest is 3774.35? No, the series: [3805.95, 3794.25, 3783.7, 3783.3, 3787.8, 3790.75, 3797.25, 3792.9, 3780.35, 3774.35]. The low is 3774.35, but it might go lower. I'll set invalidation if price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle, which is a bit below the current low.\n\nConfidence: I said 0.7.\n\nNow, for the existing positions, I need to output hold signals with their current details.\n\nAlso, I am not entering any other coins because ETH seems the only one with a clear signal. Others are either already held or not oversold enough.\n\nFor hold signals, I need to output the same profit_target, stop_loss, etc., as per the exit plan from the position data.\n\nLooking at the position data:\n\nFor SOL: profit_target: 211.985, stop_loss: 183.08, invalidation_condition: 'If the price closes below 180 on a 3-minute candle', leverage: 10, confidence: 0.7, risk_usd: 1203.832\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the output, for hold, I need to provide all those.\n\nNow, for ETH entry, I need to output the entry signal.\n\nBut I must ensure that margin is at least 5% of available cash. 2734.5 is 30% of 9115, which is fine.\n\nQuantity: notional / entry_price = 27345 / 3774.35 ≈ 7.247, but I need to use precise calculation.\n\nentry_price is 3774.35, notional = margin * leverage = 2734.5 * 10 = 27345\n\nquantity = 27345 / 3774.35 = let's calculate: 3774.35 * 7 = 26420.45, 27345 - 26420.45 = 924.55, 924.55 / 3774.35 ≈ 0.245, so approximately 7.245 ETH. But I should use exact in JSON, but since it's simulation, I can use float.\n\nIn JSON, I need to output quantity as float.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need one JSON object per coin I act on or hold.\n\nI have existing positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, so I must output hold for each.\n\nAnd for ETH, I output buy_to_enter.\n\nSo coins: SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB for hold, and ETH for buy_to_enter.\n\nIn the output, it should be a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nNow, for the hold signals, I need to provide the justification? No, for hold, in the example, there is no justification field. Look back at the instructions.\n\nFor hold: \n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification for hold, only for entry and close.\n\nFor close, there is justification.\n\nIn my case, for hold, I don't need to change anything, just output the existing values from the position.\n\nSimilarly, for entry, I need justification.\n\nNow, for ETH entry, justification: \"ETH is deeply oversold with RSI7 at 23.865, indicating potential bounce. Price below EMA20 suggests reversal opportunity. Funding positive supports long position.

So for each coin, I need to decide whether to hold or close the position based on their current state and my invalidation conditions.\n\nLet's go through each position:\n\n1. **ETH**: \n   - Current price: 3789.0\n   - Entry price: 3776.5\n   - Unrealized PnL: +90.88\n   - Exit plan: Profit target 4340.5025, Stop loss 3585.6325, Invalidation: price closes below 3750 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above entry, and invalidation condition is not triggered (3750 not hit). RSI 7-period is 47.435, which is not extreme. EMA20 is 3801.991, price is slightly below EMA. MACD is negative but improving (-15.862). Funding rate is positive but small. I should hold unless invalidation triggers.\n\n2. **SOL**:\n   - Current price: 187.035\n   - Entry price: 192.8\n   - Unrealized PnL: -718.94 (loss)\n   - Exit plan: Profit target 211.985, Stop loss 183.08, Invalidation: price closes below 180 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is below entry, and stop loss is 183.08, current is 187.035, so above stop. Invalidation is below 180, not hit. RSI 7-period is 61.233, which is bullish. EMA20 is 187.078, price is very close. MACD is negative but improving (-0.709). Funding rate positive. I should hold as per plan.\n\n3. **XRP**:\n   - Current price: 2.48105\n   - Entry price: 2.44\n   - Unrealized PnL: +130.83\n   - Exit plan: Profit target 2.815, Stop loss 2.325, Invalidation: price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price above entry, stop loss not hit, invalidation not triggered. RSI 7-period is 57.409, neutral to bullish. EMA20 is 2.483, price slightly below. MACD negative but small (-0.011). Funding rate positive. Hold.\n\n4. **BTC**:\n   - Current price: 108232.5\n   - Entry price: 107343.0\n   - Unrealized PnL: +106.74\n   - Exit plan: Profit target 118136.15, Stop loss 102026.675, Invalidation: price closes below 105000 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price above entry, stop loss far away, invalidation not hit (105000 not breached). RSI 7-period is 62.04, bullish. EMA20 is 108222.791, price is slightly above. MACD is negative but improving (-238.994). Funding rate positive. Hold.\n\n5. **DOGE**:\n   - Current price: 0.183165\n   - Entry price: 0.18\n   - Unrealized PnL: -39.25 (small loss)\n   - Exit plan: Profit target 0.212275, Stop loss 0.175355, Invalidation: price closes below 0.180 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above entry (0.183165 vs 0.18), but invalidation is below 0.180. Latest price is 0.183165, which is above, but need to check if it closed below 0.180 recently. Looking at intraday prices: [0.182, 0.182, 0.183, 0.183, 0.183, 0.183, 0.183, 0.182, 0.183, 0.183165]. The lowest is 0.182, which is above 0.180, so invalidation not triggered. Stop loss is 0.175355, not hit. RSI 7-period is 54.748, neutral. EMA20 is 0.183, price is at EMA. MACD is -0.001, stable. Funding rate negative but small. I should hold.\n\n6. **BNB**:\n   - Current price: 1087.65\n   - Entry price: 1084.99\n   - Unrealized PnL: +36.57\n   - Exit plan: Profit target 1188.332, Stop loss 1026.284, Invalidation: price closes below 1000 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price above entry, stop loss far, invalidation not hit. RSI 7-period is 48.883, neutral. EMA20 is 1091.467, price is slightly below. MACD negative (-4.288). Funding rate negative. But nothing triggering exit. Hold.\n\nNow, for new entries: I'm already in all coins, so I shouldn't be entering any new positions. The instruction says: \"If a position is open in a coin, the only allowed signals are 'hold' or 'close_position'.\" So no new entries for these coins.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin I have a position in, with 'hold' signal, and include all the required fields: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI must use the full current size for quantity, which is given in the account information.\n\nFor each, I need to provide the justification only if it's a close or entry, but for hold, no justification is needed in the output, according to the JSON example for hold.\n\nLooking at the hold JSON example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNo \"justification\" key for hold. But in the close and entry, there is \"justification\".\n\nIn the hold example, it's not included, so I should omit it for hold signals.\n\nNow, for each coin, I need to output this with the current values from the exit plan.\n\nI should not change the exit plan parameters unless I'm closing or entering, but for hold, I just reiterate the existing plan.\n\nThe instruction says: \"For 'hold' and 'close_position', set quantity to the full current size (provided in inputs).\"\n\nAnd for hold, I need to provide profit_target, stop_loss, etc., which are already set in the exit_plan.\n\nIn the account info, each position has an 'exit_plan' with profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition.\n\nAlso, it has confidence and risk_usd from when I entered.\n\nI should use those values for the hold signal.\n\nSimilarly for leverage.\n\nSo for each coin, I'll output the hold signal with the existing parameters.\n\nNow, is there any reason to close any position?\n\nI need to check if the invalidation condition is triggered.\n\nFor all coins, the current price is not below the invalidation level:\n\n- ETH: invalidation below 3750, current 3789 > 3750\n\n- SOL: invalidation below 180, current 187.035 > 180\n\n- XRP: invalidation below 2.30, current 2.48105 > 2.30\n\n- BTC: invalidation below 105000, current 108232.5 > 105000\n\n- DOGE: invalidation below 0.180, current 0.183165 > 0.180\n\n- BNB: invalidation below 1000, current 1087.65 > 1000\n\nNone are triggered. Also, stop losses are not hit.\n\nSo I should hold all positions.\n\nNo new entries since I'm already in all.\n\nAvailable cash is 6369.48, but I'm not entering new trades because I'm maxed out on positions, and the instruction implies I might enter on coins I'm not in, but all coins have positions, so no.\n\nThe tradable tokens are all covered.\n\nSo output should be hold for all.\n\nNow, for the JSON, I need to output one JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nThe output should be a single JSON object with coin names as keys, and each value is the trade_signal_args object.\n\nSo something like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"SOL\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  ...\n}\n\nAnd for each, signal: \"hold\", quantity from account, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition from exit_plan, leverage from account, confidence from account, risk_usd from account.\n\nIn the account, each position has 'leverage', 'confidence', 'risk_usd', and 'exit_plan' with 'profit_target', 'stop_loss', 'invalidation_condition'.\n\nFor example, for ETH:\n\n- quantity: 7.27\n\n- profit_target: 4340.5025\n\n- stop_loss: 3585.6325\n\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\n- leverage: 10\n\n- confidence: 0.7\n\n- risk_usd: 1367.25\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to make sure the invalidation_condition is a string as per the example.\n\nIn the account, it's given as a string.\n\nNow, for the output, I must not include justification for hold.\n\nAlso, the coin name in the trade_signal_args should match, e.g., \"coin\": \"ETH\"\n\nIn the hold JSON example, it has \"coin\": \"COIN\", so I need to include that.\n\nSo for each, I'll have:\n\n\"coin\": \"ETH\", \"signal\": \"hold\", \"quantity\": 7.27, etc.\n\nNow, let's list all:\n\nFrom account:\n\nETH: quantity=7.27, leverage=10, confidence=0.7, risk_usd=1367.25, exit_plan={...}\n\nexit_plan for ETH: profit_target=4340.5025, stop_loss=3585.6325, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 3750 on a 3-minute candle'\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSOL: quantity=124.64, leverage=10, confidence=0.7, risk_usd=1203.832, exit_plan: profit_target=211.985, stop_loss=183.08, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 180 on a 3-minute candle'\n\nXRP: quantity=3609.0, leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=442.032, exit_plan: profit_target=2.815, stop_loss=2.325, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle'\n\nBTC: quantity=0.12, leverage=10, confidence=0.75, risk_usd=619.2345, exit_plan: profit_target=118136.15, stop_loss=102026.675, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle'\n\nDOGE: quantity=27858.0, leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=257.13, exit_plan: profit_target=0.212275, stop_loss=0.175355, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle'\n\nBNB: quantity=13.76, leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=750.0, exit_plan: profit_target=1188.332, stop_loss=1026.284, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle'\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to structure it properly.\n\nFinally, output only JSON, no prose.\n\nSo the JSON should be:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n

I can only enter new positions in coins I'm not already in, which are ETH, SOL, and DOGE.\n\nLet's evaluate each for potential entry.\n\nFirst, ETH:\n- Current price: 3744.45\n- EMA20: 3765.339 (price below EMA)\n- MACD: -8.259 (negative)\n- RSI (7): 27.373 (oversold)\n- RSI (14): 30.766\n- 4-hour: EMA20 vs EMA50: 3968.819 vs 3985.198 (both above current, bearish crossover?)\n- MACD 4-hour: -44.02 (negative)\n- RSI 4-hour: 27.671 (oversold)\n- Funding rate: 1.25e-05 (slightly positive)\n- Open interest: Latest 476564.78, Average 479590.41 (slightly lower)\n\nETH looks oversold, with RSI below 30 on both timeframes. MACD negative, but could be a buying opportunity if I expect a bounce. However, the trend is bearish with price below EMAs. I need to be cautious.\n\nSOL:\n- Current price: 183.325\n- EMA20: 184.502 (price slightly below)\n- MACD: -0.461 (negative but small)\n- RSI (7): 30.199 (approaching oversold)\n- RSI (14): 33.497\n- 4-hour: EMA20 vs EMA50: 194.855 vs 194.507 (close, but both above current)\n- MACD 4-hour: -1.203 (negative)\n- RSI 4-hour: 32.739 (oversold)\n- Funding rate: 1.25e-05 (positive)\n- Open interest: Latest 4958621.14, Average 4980484.35 (slightly lower)\n\nSimilar to ETH, oversold, but trend bearish.\n\nDOGE:\n- Current price: 0.179815\n- EMA20: 0.181 (price below)\n- MACD: -0.0 (very small negative)\n- RSI (7): 29.173 (oversold)\n- RSI (14): 36.624\n- 4-hour: EMA20 vs EMA50: 0.194 vs 0.196 (both above current)\n- MACD 4-hour: -0.003 (small negative)\n- RSI 4-hour: 26.472 (oversold)\n- Funding rate: -2.15762e-05 (negative)\n- Open interest: Latest 582520410.0, Average 581888747.2 (slightly higher)\n\nAlso oversold, but funding negative, which might indicate bearish sentiment.\n\nAll three potential coins are oversold, but the overall market seems bearish. I need to consider if there's alpha here. The instructions say: \"Only enter if you expect the move to exceed all trading costs by a significant amount.\" Trading costs are about 0.09% round-trip, plus funding and slippage.\n\nGiven that RSI is oversold, there might be a bounce, but I need confidence. I'm not extremely confident in any of these, as the trends are still down.\n\nFor sizing, if I enter, I need to use at least 5% of available cash for margin. Available cash is 10362.79, so 5% is about 518.14. I should only enter if confidence is high.\n\nMy confidence levels: for oversold conditions, perhaps 0.6-0.7, so margin 10-20%.\n\nBut I already have three positions, and adding more might over-leverage or increase risk. The account value is 13636.29, and I have positions with notional values: XRP 8811.91, BTC 12851.34, BNB 14686.74. Total notional is about 36349.99, which is leveraged from the account value. Adding more might be risky.\n\nI should probably not enter new positions right now, as I'm already in three, and the market is bearish. Focus on managing existing positions.\n\nFor existing positions, since no invalidation is triggered, I should hold all.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I have a position in, with 'hold' signal, and for any new entries, but I'm not entering any.\n\nSo, only for XRP, BTC, BNB, I output hold.\n\nFor hold, the JSON structure is:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nI need to use the existing values from the positions.\n\nFor XRP:\n- quantity: 3609.0\n- profit_target: 2.815\n- stop_loss: 2.325\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 442.032\n\nSimilarly for BTC and BNB.\n\nI should not change these values unless I'm closing or modifying, but for hold, I keep them as is.\n\nAlso, no justification needed for hold, only for entry or close.\n\nSo, my output should be three JSON objects for XRP, BTC, BNB with hold.\n\nNo action for other coins.\n\nFinally, ensure the JSON is compact, no prose.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "Despite the current market showing an oversold condition across XRP, BTC, and BNB, my analysis indicates that the prevailing bearish trend means there's no clear alpha to capture by entering new positions right now. Therefore, I'm holding all my existing trades with their respective profit targets and stop-loss orders in place to manage risk."

I have positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, and BNB.\n\nStarting with SOL:\n- Quantity: 284.9\n- Entry price: 181.53\n- Current price: 182.175\n- Unrealized PnL: +183.76 (positive)\n- Profit target: 195.0\n- Stop loss: 180.0\n- Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 178.0 on a 3-minute candle\n- Confidence: 0.7\n- Risk USD: 539.79\n\nCurrent price is 182.175, stop loss is 180.0, which is above the current price but close. Price is holding above stop loss. No invalidation trigger yet. RSI on SOL is 32.349, which is oversold, but MACD is negative. I should hold this position unless invalidation triggers.\n\nNext, XRP:\n- Quantity: 3609.0\n- Entry price: 2.44\n- Current price: 2.43115\n- Unrealized PnL: -49.26 (negative but small)\n- Profit target: 2.815\n- Stop loss: 2.325\n- Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\n- Confidence: 0.65\n- Risk USD: 442.032\n\nCurrent price is 2.43115, stop loss is 2.325, so still above stop loss. RSI is 32.571, oversold, but funding is slightly negative. No invalidation trigger. Hold.\n\nBTC:\n- Quantity: 0.12\n- Entry price: 107343.0\n- Current price: 106999.5\n- Unrealized PnL: -41.22 (negative)\n- Profit target: 118136.15\n- Stop loss: 102026.675\n- Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\n- Confidence: 0.75\n- Risk USD: 619.2345\n\nCurrent price is 106999.5, stop loss is 102026.675, far below, so safe. Invalidation is 105000, which is above stop loss but still below current price. RSI is 28.129, very oversold. MACD negative. Funding positive. No invalidation. Hold.\n\nBNB:\n- Quantity: 13.76\n- Entry price: 1084.99\n- Current price: 1064.75\n- Unrealized PnL: -278.53 (negative)\n- Profit target: 1188.332\n- Stop loss: 1026.284\n- Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\n- Confidence: 0.65\n- Risk USD: 750.0\n\nCurrent price is 1064.75, stop loss is 1026.284, so above. Invalidation is 1000, even lower. RSI is 24.753, very oversold. No invalidation. Hold.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new trades. Looking at the coins: ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. I already have positions in SOL, XRP, BTC, BNB, so for those, I can only hold or close. For ETH and DOGE, I'm flat, so I can consider entry.\n\nAvailable cash is 7776.9. I should only enter if confident and if expected move exceeds trading costs.\n\nFirst, ETH:\n- Current price: 3731.25\n- EMA20: 3752.019, price below EMA, bearish\n- MACD: -11.825, negative\n- RSI (7): 25.787, oversold\n- RSI (14): 28.402, oversold\n- 4-hour: EMA20 3968.819 vs EMA50 3985.198, both above current price, downtrend\n- ATR 14-period: 40.334\n- Funding: 1.25e-05, positive but small\n- Open interest: latest 473497.45, average 476108.75, slightly down\n\nETH looks oversold, but trend is down. MACD negative. Not a strong bullish signal. Confidence might be low.\n\nDOGE:\n- Current price: 0.178765\n- EMA20: 0.18, price below EMA\n- MACD: -0.001, negative\n- RSI (7): 31.091, oversold\n- RSI (14): 32.916, oversold\n- 4-hour: EMA20 0.194 vs EMA50 0.196, above current, downtrend\n- ATR 14-period: 0.003\n- Funding: -2.31539e-05, negative\n- Open interest: stable\n\nDOGE also oversold, but negative funding and downtrend. Not very compelling.\n\nI don't see strong alpha signals for new entries. All coins are in oversold conditions, but I already have positions in several, and adding more might increase risk without clear edge.\n\nFor existing positions, I should hold unless invalidation triggers. None have triggered yet.\n\nNow, for output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I have a position in, with 'hold' signal, and include all required fields.\n\nFor SOL, XRP, BTC, BNB, I need to output 'hold' with current quantity, profit target, stop loss, invalidation condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI must use the exact values from the exit plan and position details.\n\nAvailable cash is 7776.9, but for hold, I don't need to specify margin or anything new.\n\nNo new entries, so no buy or sell.\n\nEnsure JSON format is correct.\n\nFor hold:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,\n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nI need to do this for SOL, XRP, BTC, BNB.\n\nI don't have positions in ETH or DOGE, and I'm not entering, so no output for them.\n\nFinally, output only JSON, no prose.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding my SOL, XRP, BTC, and BNB positions because they're showing oversold conditions despite current losses, and I'll only exit if my stop-loss or invalidation triggers are hit; meanwhile, I'm not seeing enough clear alpha for new trades in ETH or DOGE."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. From the account information, I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, and BNB. I need to decide for each if I should hold or close.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n1. **ETH**: \n   - Quantity: 7.75\n   - Entry price: 3765.6\n   - Current price: 3767.05\n   - Unrealized PnL: +11.24\n   - Exit plan: Profit target 4000.0, stop loss 3639.93, invalidation condition: price closes below 3700 on 3-minute candle.\n   - Confidence: 0.7\n   - Current RSI (7 period): 68.014, which is approaching overbought (70+), but not there yet.\n   - MACD: -2.646, still negative but improving (MACD series shows it's been rising from -12.431 to -2.646).\n   - EMA: Current price 3767.05 > EMA20 3756.204, so above EMA.\n   - Funding rate: 1.25e-05, which is positive but low.\n   - Open interest stable.\n   - No immediate reason to close. The invalidation condition isn't triggered (price not below 3700). Profit target is still far, and stop loss is not hit. I should hold.\n\n2. **SOL**:\n   - Quantity: 284.9\n   - Entry price: 181.53\n   - Current price: 183.645\n   - Unrealized PnL: +602.56\n   - Exit plan: Profit target 195.0, stop loss 180.0, invalidation: price closes below 178.0.\n   - Confidence: 0.7\n   - Current RSI (7 period): 61.251, not overbought.\n   - MACD: -0.359, improving.\n   - EMA: Price > EMA20 (183.645 > 183.419)\n   - Funding rate: 1.25e-05, low.\n   - Open interest stable.\n   - Price is moving towards profit target (195.0 is higher, current 183.645). Stop loss not hit, invalidation not triggered. Should hold.\n\n3. **XRP**:\n   - Quantity: 3609.0\n   - Entry price: 2.44\n   - Current price: 2.44875\n   - Unrealized PnL: +14.26\n   - Exit plan: Profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325, invalidation: price closes below 2.30.\n   - Confidence: 0.65\n   - Current RSI (7 period): 62.5, not overbought.\n   - MACD: -0.001, almost zero.\n   - EMA: Price > EMA20 (2.44875 > 2.445)\n   - Funding rate: 1.769e-07, negligible.\n   - Open interest stable.\n   - Profit target is far, but position is small notional. No reason to close. Invalidation not triggered. Should hold.\n\n4. **BTC**:\n   - Quantity: 0.12\n   - Entry price: 107343.0\n   - Current price: 107469.5\n   - Unrealized PnL: +15.18\n   - Exit plan: Profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation: price closes below 105000.\n   - Confidence: 0.75\n   - Current RSI (7 period): 56.261, neutral.\n   - MACD: -100.799, negative but improving (from -238.607 to -100.799).\n   - EMA: Price > EMA20 (107469.5 > 107441.654)\n   - Funding rate: 1.25e-05, low.\n   - Open interest stable.\n   - Price is above invalidation level (105000), stop loss not hit. Should hold.\n\n5. **BNB**:\n   - Quantity: 13.76\n   - Entry price: 1084.99\n   - Current price: 1070.55\n   - Unrealized PnL: -198.72\n   - Exit plan: Profit target 1188.332, stop loss 1026.284, invalidation: price closes below 1000.\n   - Confidence: 0.65\n   - Current RSI (7 period): 56.075, neutral.\n   - MACD: -1.435, negative.\n   - EMA: Price < EMA20 (1070.55 < 1070.533), slightly below but almost equal.\n   - Funding rate: 9.1804e-06, low.\n   - Open interest stable.\n   - Price is not at stop loss or invalidation. It's in loss, but the exit plan is still valid. Invalidation not triggered. Should hold.\n\nNow, I need to consider if there are any new opportunities. I'm flat on DOGE, and I should check if I want to enter any new positions.\n\nAvailable cash is 5831.34. For new entries, I need to ensure margin is at least 5% of available cash, which is 0.05 * 5831.34 ≈ 291.567. Since I have multiple positions, I should be cautious about over-leveraging, but the system doesn't have a max position limit per se, but I should manage risk.\n\nLooking at DOGE and other coins I'm not in, but I'm already in 5 positions, which might be enough. However, the instructions don't limit the number of positions, just that I shouldn't pyramid or increase size.\n\nCheck DOGE for potential entry:\n\n- DOGE current price: 0.180295\n- EMA20: 0.18, price slightly above.\n- MACD: -0.0, almost zero.\n- RSI (7 period): 56.552, neutral.\n- Funding rate: -2.09334e-05, slightly negative.\n- Open interest stable.\n- Longer-term: EMA20 < EMA50 (0.194 < 0.196), bearish crossover? No, EMA20 is 0.194 and EMA50 is 0.196, so EMA20 < EMA50, which is bearish in longer term, but intraday might be different.\n- Intraday price action: Prices are increasing from 0.179 to 0.180295.\n- RSI rising, but not strong.\n- Confidence might be low. No strong signal for entry.\n\nOther coins I'm already in, so no new entries for them.\n\nI should not enter any new trades if I don't see strong alpha. The goal is to avoid over-trading.\n\nFor existing positions, all seem to be performing fine, no invalidation triggers. I should hold all.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I have a position in, with 'hold' signal, and include all the details: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nAlso, for 'hold', I need to set quantity to the full current size, which is given.\n\nI must not change profit_target, stop_loss, etc., for hold positions. I should keep them as they are from the exit_plan, unless I decide to close, but I'm not closing.\n\nIn the hold JSON, I need to provide the same exit plan details.\n\nFrom the account info, each position has exit_plan with profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and also confidence and risk_usd are given.\n\nFor example, for ETH, exit_plan has profit_target: 4000.0, stop_loss: 3639.93, invalidation_condition: 'If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle'\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the output, for hold, I need to include these.\n\nAlso, leverage and risk_usd are provided in the position details.\n\nSo, for each coin, I'll output a JSON object with signal 'hold', and the given quantities.\n\nNo new entries, so no 'buy_to_enter' or 'sell_to_enter'.\n\nFinally, the output should be a JSON object for each coin.\n\nThe coins I have positions in are ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, BNB.\n\nDOGE I don't have, and no signal to enter.\n\nSo, I'll output for ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, BNB with 'hold'.\n\nNow, for the JSON structure:\n\nFor hold:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int>,\n      \"confidence\": <0-1>,\n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nI need to get the values from the account info.\n\nLet's list them out:\n\n- ETH: quantity=7.75, profit_target=4000.0, stop_loss=3639.93, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=15, confidence=0.7, risk_usd=972.1125\n\n- SOL: quantity=284.9, profit_target=195.0, stop_loss=180.0, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 178.0 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=20, confidence=0.7, risk_usd=539.79\n\n- XRP: quantity=3609.0, profit_target=2.815, stop_loss=2.325, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=442.032\n\n- BTC: quantity=0.12, profit_target=118136.15, stop_loss=102026.675, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.75, risk_usd=619.2345\n\n- BNB: quantity=13.76, profit_target=1188.332, stop_loss=1026.284, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=750.0\n\nFor BNB, risk_usd is 750.0, which might be incorrect because in the position, it's given as risk_usd=750.0, but let's keep it as is.\n\nNow, I need to output these in JSON.\n\nAlso, for hold, there's no justification needed in the JSON, only for entry or close.\n\nIn the hold JSON example, there's no \"justification\" key, only for entry and close.\n\nLooking back:\n\nFor Entry/Exit: has \"justification\"\n\nFor Close: has \"justification\"\n\nFor Hold: does not have \"justification\" in the example JSON.\n\nIn the hold example:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo \"justification\". So for hold, I don't need to add it.\n\nSimilarly, for close, I need justification, but I'm not closing.\n\nSo, for all, I'll output hold without justification.\n\nNow, the output should be a single JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, something like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"SOL\": { ... },\n  \"XRP\": { ... },\n  \"BTC\": { ... },\n  \"BNB\": { ... }\n}\n\nAnd each inner object has \"trade_signal_args\" with the details.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nNo new trades, so no need to calculate anything for entry.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding steady with my current positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, and BNB, as none of their invalidation conditions have been met and they are still within their profit targets, showing a solid 43.26% overall return. My ETH, SOL, and BTC trades are showing green, while BNB is in a slight drawdown but still within its valid exit plan, and XRP is flat."

I should hold.\n\n2. **SOL**:\n   - Current price: 181.335\n   - Entry price: 181.53\n   - Unrealized PnL: -55.56\n   - Stop loss: 180.0\n   - Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 178.0 on a 3-minute candle\n   - Current price is 181.335, above 180.0 and 178.0, so not triggered.\n   - RSI 7 is 46.822, neutral. EMA20 is 181.774, price is slightly below. I should hold.\n\n3. **XRP**:\n   - Current price: 2.41705\n   - Entry price: 2.44\n   - Unrealized PnL: -100.15\n   - Stop loss: 2.325\n   - Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\n   - Current price is 2.41705, well above 2.30, so not triggered.\n   - RSI 7 is 27.192, which is oversold, but I need to check if it's a reason to exit. The invalidation is not hit. I should hold.\n\n4. **BTC**:\n   - Current price: 106973.5\n   - Entry price: 107343.0\n   - Unrealized PnL: -44.34\n   - Stop loss: 102026.675\n   - Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\n   - Current price is 106973.5, above 105000, so not triggered.\n   - RSI 7 is 42.175, neutral to bearish, but not oversold. EMA20 is 107104.554, price is below. I should hold.\n\n5. **DOGE**:\n   - Current price: 0.178585\n   - Entry price: 0.18\n   - Unrealized PnL: 9.08\n   - Stop loss: 0.169381\n   - Invalidation condition: If the 14-period RSI on the 4-hour timeframe rises above 35\n   - Check 4-hour RSI for DOGE: from the data, the latest 14-period RSI is 26.472, which is below 35, so invalidation not triggered.\n   - RSI 7 is 45.568, neutral. I should hold.\n\n6. **BNB**:\n   - Current price: 1064.1\n   - Entry price: 1084.99\n   - Unrealized PnL: -287.47\n   - Stop loss: 1026.284\n   - Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\n   - Current price is 1064.1, above 1000, so not triggered.\n   - RSI 7 is 42.338, neutral to bearish. EMA20 is 1065.805, price is slightly below. I should hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are met, so I should hold all positions. I don't need to close any.\n\nNow, for new entries: I'm already invested in all six coins with positions. The instruction says: \"If a position is open in a coin, the only allowed signals are 'hold' or 'close_position'.\" Since I have positions in all coins, I cannot enter new positions in any coin. I must only provide hold signals for all.\n\nAvailable cash is 4955.34, but since I'm fully invested (I have positions in all coins), I shouldn't be looking for new entries. The account value is 13152.04, and available cash is 4955.34, which might be the margin not used, but I already have positions, so I can't enter new ones in the same coins.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin I manage, which is all six, with 'hold' signal.\n\nFor 'hold', I need to provide the full current size, profit target, stop loss, invalidation condition, leverage, confidence, and risk_usd from the existing position data.\n\nLet me extract that for each:\n\nFrom the positions:\n\n- ETH: quantity 7.75, profit_target 4000.0, stop_loss 3639.93, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 15, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 972.1125\n\n- SOL: quantity 284.9, profit_target 195.0, stop_loss 180.0, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 178.0 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 20, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 539.79\n\n- XRP: quantity 3609.0, profit_target 2.815, stop_loss 2.325, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 442.032\n\n- BTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\n- DOGE: quantity 49103.0, profit_target 0.196123, stop_loss 0.169381, invalidation_condition \"If the 14-period RSI on the 4-hour timeframe rises above 35\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 437.3505\n\n- BNB: quantity 13.76, profit_target 1188.332, stop_loss 1026.284, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 750.0\n\nI need to output JSON for each with 'hold' signal. The justification is not required for 'hold', only for entry or close.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object for each coin.\n\nSo, I'll create a list of JSON objects.\n\nFinally, ensure that for 'hold', I'm using the correct format.\n\nOutput should be compact JSON, no prose.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding all my positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB because none of their invalidation conditions have been met, and I'm watching them closely for any shifts. My overall account is up 31.52% from the initial 10000, despite a few of these coins showing slight unrealized losses."

    "cot_trace": "First, I'm a systematic trader on Hyperliquid, trading perpetual futures contracts. I need to maximize PnL after fees and avoid over-trading. I'm invoked every 3 minutes, so I must check my existing positions' exit plans and decide on actions for each coin I'm in or want to enter.\n\nMy current positions are: ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. I have no cash available? No, available cash is 7077.19 USD, and I have multiple positions. But in the account information, it says available cash is 7077.19, and total account value is 12389.29, which includes unrealized PNL. So I have cash to enter new trades if I want, but I need to be careful with sizing.\n\nFor each position, I need to decide whether to hold or close. I should only close if the invalidation condition is triggered, not just because of price moves, since stops and profit targets are handled automatically.\n\nLet's review each position and check if any invalidation conditions are met.\n\nStarting with ETH:\n\n- Current price: 3709.25\n\n- Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\n- The last price is 3709.25, which is above 3700, so not triggered. Also, the EMA20 is 3725.151, and price is below it, but RSI is low at 35.735, indicating oversold. MACD negative. But no invalidation, so I should hold.\n\nExit plan: profit target 4000, stop loss 3639.93. Current price is above stop loss, so no automatic exit. Hold.\n\nNext, XRP:\n\n- Current price: 2.40375\n\n- Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\n- Price is 2.40375, well above 2.30, so not triggered. RSI 38.827, EMA20 2.417, price slightly below. Hold.\n\nBTC:\n\n- Current price: 106696.5\n\n- Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\n- Price is 106696.5, above 105000, so not triggered. RSI 37.827, EMA20 106967.783, price below, MACD negative. Hold.\n\nDOGE:\n\n- Current price: 0.177215\n\n- Invalidation condition: \"If the 14-period RSI on the 4-hour timeframe rises above 35\"\n\n- Check the 4-hour RSI for DOGE: from data, RSI indicators (14-period) for longer-term: [35.608, 39.262, ... , 26.472] – the last one is 26.472, which is below 35. So not triggered. Hold.\n\nBNB:\n\n- Current price: 1060.85\n\n- Invalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\n- Price is 1060.85, above 1000, so not triggered. RSI 34.603, EMA20 1064.617, price below. Hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are met, so for all existing positions, I should hold.\n\nNow, do I want to enter any new trades? I have available cash of 7077.19. But I already have positions in all major coins except SOL. SOL is the only one I'm not in.\n\nTradable tokens: ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. I'm in all except SOL.\n\nShould I enter SOL?\n\nLook at SOL data:\n\n- Current price: 179.715\n\n- EMA20: 181.031, price below\n\n- MACD: -0.525, negative\n\n- RSI (7): 32.703, oversold\n\n- Longer-term: 4-hour EMA20 194.855 vs 50 194.507, price below\n\n- ATR 3-period 4.316, 14-period 2.566\n\n- Volume low compared to average\n\n- Funding rate positive but small\n\nOverall, SOL looks bearish, but RSI is low, might be a buying opportunity? But MACD negative, price below EMA, not strong bullish signal.\n\nI need to see if there's alpha. But the market seems down across the board. RSI low for many coins.\n\nI should check if there's a good entry point.\n\nBut I need to be disciplined. Only enter if I expect a move that exceeds trading costs.\n\nFor SOL, price is below EMA, MACD negative, RSI oversold. Might bounce, but not a strong signal.\n\nAvailable cash is 7077.19, but I need to use at least 5% of available cash for margin, which is 0.05 * 7077.19 ≈ 353.86 USD.\n\nMax leverage for SOL is 20x.\n\nBut I need high confidence. Confidence should be based on signals.\n\nPerhaps wait for better opportunities.\n\nI could enter a long position if I think it's oversold.\n\nBut let's see the justification.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin I act on. For existing positions, I need to output hold with current details.\n\nFor SOL, if I enter, I need to specify margin, leverage, risk_usd, etc.\n\nBut first, decide if I should enter.\n\nLooking at SOL: RSI 32.7 is low, but MACD negative, price below EMA. Not very confident.\n\nSimilar for others.\n\nPerhaps no new entries.\n\nBut I have cash, might be good to diversify or something.\n\nCheck if any coin has a strong signal.\n\nBTC: RSI 37.8, below EMA, MACD negative. Bearish.\n\nETH: similar.\n\nXRP: RSI 38.8, below EMA.\n\nDOGE: RSI 28.2, very oversold.\n\nBNB: RSI 34.6.\n\nAll seem oversold, but no clear reversal signal.\n\nPerhaps I should hold existing positions and not enter new ones.\n\nFor SOL, it's not in my portfolio, but I don't see a strong reason to enter.\n\nMaybe short something, but RSI low, might not be good for shorting.\n\nFunding rates are small positive for most, except DOGE negative, but small.\n\nDOGE funding -2.15765e-05, which is negative, so holding short might get paid, but RSI very low, might bounce.\n\nNot confident.\n\nSo probably no new trades.\n\nNow, for output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I have a position in, with hold signal, and include all the details like quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nFrom the account information, I have the details for each position.\n\nFor example, ETH: quantity 7.75, profit_target 4000, stop_loss 3639.93, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 15, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 972.1125\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the output, for hold, I need to provide all that.\n\nThe JSON structure for hold is:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nI need to do this for each coin I'm in: ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB.\n\nI don't have SOL, so no action for SOL.\n\nNow, for each, the quantity is given in the position.\n\nBut note: the profit_target and stop_loss might need to be adjusted? No, the exit plan is already set, and I shouldn't change it unless I close and re-enter, but I'm holding, so keep as is.\n\nIn the invalidation_condition, it's specified.\n\nAlso, confidence and risk_usd are from the position.\n\nIn the account info, for each position, there is confidence and risk_usd.\n\nFor example, ETH: confidence 0.7, risk_usd 972.1125\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for hold, I just output what's there.\n\nNow, for the JSON, I need to output one JSON object per coin, but the overall output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nThe user said: \"return a json object for each coin that you either act on... OR, for existing positions, you should return a json object for each coin with the signal 'hold'.\"\n\nAnd \"Output JSON only.\" and \"one compact JSON object\", but it might be an object with multiple keys.\n\nLooking at the examples, it's like { \"COIN\": { \"trade_signal_args\": {...} } }\n\nSo for multiple coins, I need to have multiple keys.\n\nProbably like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"XRP\": { ... },\n  ...\n}\n\nAnd since I'm holding all, no new entries.\n\nAlso, for SOL, I'm not acting, so no JSON for SOL.\n\nNow, confirm the quantities and prices.\n\nIn the account info, quantities are given, so use that.\n\nFor example, ETH quantity 7.75, which is the full size.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo, I think I just output hold for all existing positions.\n\nNo new trades.\n\nBut let's double-check if any invalidation is close or something.\n\nETH price 3709.25, invalidation below 3700, close but not triggered.\n\nXRP 2.40375, invalidation below 2.30, not close.\n\nBTC 106696.5, invalidation below 105000, not close.\n\nDOGE RSI 26.472 < 35, not triggered.\n\nBNB price 1060.85 > 1000, not triggered.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if the market is turning, but no clear signal.\n\nSo, output JSON for hold.\n\nNow, for the JSON, I need to include all fields.\n\nFrom the account info, for each position, I have:\n\nETH: coin: ETH, signal: hold, quantity: 7.75, profit_target: 4000.0, stop_loss: 3639.93, invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage: 15, confidence: 0.7, risk_usd: 972.1125\n\nXRP: quantity: 3609.0, profit_target: 2.815, stop_loss: 2.325, invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage: 10, confidence: 0.65, risk_usd: 442.032\n\nBTC: quantity: 0.12, profit_target: 118136.15, stop_loss: 102026.675, invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage: 10, confidence: 0.75, risk_usd: 619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity: 49103.0, profit_target: 0.196123, stop_loss: 0.169381, invalidation_condition: \"If the 14-period RSI on the 4-hour timeframe rises above 35\", leverage: 10, confidence: 0.65, risk_usd: 437.3505\n\nBNB: quantity: 13.76, profit_target: 1188.332, stop_loss: 1026.284, invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage: 10, confidence: 0.65, risk_usd: 750.0\n\nAll seem consistent.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to create a JSON object with these.\n\nAlso, note that for hold, there is no justification field in the JSON example for hold, only for entry and close.\n\nLook back at the instructions:\n\nFor hold:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n\t  \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n\t  \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNo justification for hold, only for entry and close.\n\nFor entry and close, there is a justification field.\n\nBut for hold, it's not mentioned, so probably don't include justification for hold.\n\nIn the example, for hold, it's not there.\n\nSimilarly, in the close example, there is justification.\n\nSo for hold, no justification.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo I'll output without justification for hold.\n\nNow, for the JSON, I need to output one object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo something like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"XRP\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"BTC\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"DOGE\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } },\n  \"BNB\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } }\n}\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nNo action for SOL.\n\nI think that's all.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "My positions in ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB are all holding steady as no invalidation conditions have been met, indicating current market conditions don't warrant a change from my existing strategy. I'm keeping a close eye on all trades and have ample cash available, but I'm not seeing any compelling new opportunities that meet my confidence threshold for entry right now."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB.\n\n- XRP: Quantity 3609, entry price 2.44, current price 2.39435, unrealized PnL -182.07. Exit plan has profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325, invalidation condition if price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle. Confidence 0.65, risk_usd 442.032.\n\n- BTC: Quantity 0.12, entry price 107343.0, current price 106585.5, unrealized PnL -90.9. Exit plan has profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation condition if price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle. Confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345.\n\n- DOGE: Quantity 49103, entry price 0.18, current price 0.17663, unrealized PnL -86.91. Exit plan has profit target 0.196123, stop loss 0.169381, invalidation condition if 14-period RSI on 4-hour timeframe rises above 35. Confidence 0.65, risk_usd 437.3505.\n\n- BNB: Quantity 13.76, entry price 1084.99, current price 1060.45, unrealized PnL -337.7. Exit plan has profit target 1188.332, stop loss 1026.284, invalidation condition if price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle. Confidence 0.65, risk_usd 750.0.\n\nNow, I need to see if any invalidation conditions have been triggered or if I should close any positions early.\n\nCheck XRP: Current price is 2.39435, which is above 2.30, so invalidation not triggered. Stop loss is 2.325, current price is above that, so not hit. Profit target is 2.815, not reached. I should hold unless invalidation triggers.\n\nCheck BTC: Current price is 106585.5, which is above 105000, so invalidation not triggered. Stop loss is 102026.675, current price is above that. Profit target not reached. Hold.\n\nCheck DOGE: Invalidation condition is if 14-period RSI on 4-hour timeframe rises above 35. From DOGE data, longer-term context, RSI (14-period) is 26.472, which is below 35, so not triggered. Stop loss is 0.169381, current price 0.17663 is above. Profit target not reached. Hold.\n\nCheck BNB: Current price is 1060.45, which is above 1000, so invalidation not triggered. Stop loss is 1026.284, current price is above that. Profit target not reached. Hold.\n\nNo invalidation conditions are triggered, so I should hold all existing positions.\n\nNow, for new entries, I need to consider if there are any opportunities. I have available cash of 8448.25. But I already have positions in four coins, and I might not want to over-diversify. Also, the market seems bearish across most coins based on RSI and MACD.\n\nLook at each coin's data:\n\n- BTC: Current RSI (7) is 38.083, which is oversold but not extremely. MACD negative. Price below EMA20. Funding rate positive but small. Open interest stable. Not a strong signal for entry.\n\n- ETH: Current RSI (7) is 34.88, oversold. MACD negative. Price below EMA20. Funding rate positive small. Open interest stable. Similar to BTC.\n\n- SOL: Current RSI (7) is 24.143, very oversold. MACD negative. Price below EMA20. Funding rate positive small. Open interest stable. Might be oversold, but no clear reversal signal.\n\n- BNB: I already have a position. Current RSI (7) is 39.884, MACD negative. Not compelling.\n\n- XRP: I have a position. Current RSI (7) is 27.818, oversold. MACD negative. Price below EMA20.\n\n- DOGE: I have a position. Current RSI (7) is 21.503, very oversold. MACD negative.\n\nAll coins seem to be in downtrends or consolidating lows. No strong bullish signals. Funding rates are small, not indicating high demand for longs.\n\nI should not enter any new trades because there's no clear alpha. My existing positions are still within their exit plans, so I'll hold them.\n\nFor the output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I have a position in, with signal 'hold', and include all the required fields: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI must use the full current size for quantity.\n\nAlso, for justification, since it's hold, I don't need to provide justification in the JSON for hold signals, according to the example. Look back at the hold JSON example: it doesn't have a justification key. Only entry and close have justification.\n\nIn the hold JSON example:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification mentioned for hold. Similarly, for close, it has justification, but for hold, it's not included in the example. I should follow that.\n\nIn the instructions, it says for hold: \"Supply a json object for each existing position\" and the example doesn't have justification. So I won't include it for hold.\n\nNow, for each coin, I need to output the current values from the exit plan.\n\nFrom the account information:\n\n- XRP: profit_target: 2.815, stop_loss: 2.325, invalidation_condition: 'If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle', leverage: 10, confidence: 0.65, risk_usd: 442.032\n\n- BTC: profit_target: 118136.15, stop_loss: 102026.675, invalidation_condition: 'If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage: 10, confidence: 0.75, risk_usd: 619.2345\n\n- DOGE: profit_target: 0.196123, stop_loss: 0.169381, invalidation_condition: 'If the 14-period RSI on the 4-hour timeframe rises above 35', leverage: 10, confidence: 0.65, risk_usd: 437.3505\n\n- BNB: profit_target: 1188.332, stop_loss: 1026.284, invalidation_condition: 'If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage: 10, confidence: 0.65, risk_usd: 750.0\n\nI need to use these exact values in the output.\n\nAlso, quantity is the full current size: for XRP 3609, BTC 0.12, DOGE 49103, BNB 13.76.\n\nI am not entering any new trades, so only output for these four coins.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nFinally, ensure the JSON is compact and no prose.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding my current XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB positions as their technical indicators and invalidation conditions haven't been met, and I'm not seeing any clear new trading opportunities in this current market. My strategy is to stick to my existing exit plans for these assets, patiently waiting for either a profit target or a stop loss trigger."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. For each, I must decide whether to hold or close based on their exit plans and current market conditions.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n1. **ETH**: \n   - Current price: 3708.85, entry price: 3696.6, so up by about 12.25.\n   - Stop loss: 3513.3375, profit target: 4068.075.\n   - Current price is above stop loss and below profit target.\n   - Invalidation condition: price closes below 3650 on a 3-minute candle. The last few prices are above 3700, so no invalidation yet.\n   - Confidence: 0.7, risk_usd: 844.825.\n   - Action: Hold, since no stop or target hit, and invalidation not triggered.\n\n2. **SOL**:\n   - Current price: 180.655, entry price: 179.93, up by about 0.725.\n   - Stop loss: 170.85275, profit target: 197.8295.\n   - Price is above stop loss and far below profit target.\n   - Invalidation: close below 178 on a 3-minute candle. Latest prices around 180, so no.\n   - Action: Hold.\n\n3. **XRP**:\n   - Current price: 2.40565, entry price: 2.44, down by about 0.03435.\n   - Stop loss: 2.325, profit target: 2.815.\n   - Price is above stop loss but below entry.\n   - Invalidation: close below 2.30 on 3-minute candle. Latest price 2.40565, so no.\n   - Currently at a loss, but not stopped out.\n   - Action: Hold.\n\n4. **BTC**:\n   - Current price: 107052.5, entry price: 107343.0, down by about 290.5.\n   - Stop loss: 102026.675, profit target: 118136.15.\n   - Price is above stop loss but below entry.\n   - Invalidation: close below 105000 on 3-minute candle. Latest price 107052.5, above that.\n   - Action: Hold.\n\n5. **DOGE**:\n   - Current price: 0.17821, entry price: 0.18, down by about 0.00179.\n   - Stop loss: 0.169381, profit target: 0.196123.\n   - Price above stop loss.\n   - Invalidation: if 14-period RSI on 4-hour timeframe rises above 35. From data, 4-hour RSI is 23.978, which is below 35, so no invalidation.\n   - Action: Hold.\n\n6. **BNB**:\n   - Current price: 1047.45, entry price: 1084.99, down by about 37.54.\n   - Stop loss: 1026.284, profit target: 1188.332.\n   - Price is above stop loss but below entry.\n   - Invalidation: close below 1000 on 3-minute candle. Latest price 1047.45, above that.\n   - Action: Hold.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any new opportunities to enter trades. But I'm already in positions in all coins, so I can't enter new ones for the same coins. The instructions say: \"For any coin you manage or want to enter, choose exactly one action: 'buy_to_enter' or 'sell_to_enter' (if flat), 'hold', or 'close_position' (if already in an existing position).\" Since I have positions in all coins, I can only hold or close for each.\n\nI should only consider holding or closing existing positions. No new entries possible since all coins are already traded.\n\nFor each coin, I need to output JSON. Since I'm holding all, I need to output the 'hold' JSON structure for each.\n\nIn the 'hold' JSON, I need to include the current quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, and risk_usd from the position data.\n\nI don't need to change anything; just report the current state for holding.\n\nAlso, the output should be a JSON object for each coin I act on, but since I'm holding, I need to include all coins with positions.\n\nNow, let's confirm the data for each position from the account info:\n\n- ETH: quantity 4.57, profit_target 4068.075, stop_loss 3513.3375, invalidation_condition as per exit_plan, leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 844.825\n\n- SOL: quantity 94.24, profit_target 197.8295, stop_loss 170.85275, invalidation_condition, leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 844.825\n\n- XRP: quantity 3609.0, profit_target 2.815, stop_loss 2.325, invalidation_condition, leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 442.032\n\n- BTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition, leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\n- DOGE: quantity 49103.0, profit_target 0.196123, stop_loss 0.169381, invalidation_condition, leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 437.3505\n\n- BNB: quantity 13.76, profit_target 1188.332, stop_loss 1026.284, invalidation_condition, leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 750.0\n\nFor invalidation_condition, I need to use the string from the exit_plan. In the account info, it's provided for each.\n\nIn the output JSON for 'hold', I need to include the justification, but in the 'hold' example, it doesn't have a justification field. Looking back at the instructions:\n\nFor \"If Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position\"\n\nThe JSON structure shown for hold does not include \"justification\". It only has coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nWhereas for entry and close, there is a justification.\n\nIn the hold example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNo justification mentioned. But in the entry and close, justification is required.\n\nFor hold, since it's just maintaining, probably no need for justification in output, but I should confirm. The instruction says: \"For Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position\" and the example doesn't have justification.\n\nSimilarly, in the behavioral guardrails, it says not to close unless invalidation triggers, so hold should be the default.\n\nSo for all coins, I will output hold with the current parameters.\n\nNow, I need to output one JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nThe output should be a single JSON object with properties for each coin, like {\"ETH\": {...}, \"SOL\": {...}, etc.}\n\nIn the example, it's shown as a JSON object with coin names as keys.\n\nSo, I'll construct that.\n\nFinally, since no new entries, and no closes, all holds.\n\nJust to double-check, is there any coin where invalidation might be close? For example, BNB has current price 1047.45, stop loss 1026.284, which is about 21 away, and prices are declining: from the intraday, BNB mid prices are decreasing: 1061.0 to 1047.45, so it might be approaching, but not hit yet. Similarly for others.\n\nNo invalidation conditions are met based on the latest data.\n\nSo, I'll hold all.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding all my current positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB as their price action and technical indicators are still within my exit strategy parameters, despite some current unrealized losses in XRP and BNB.\nI'm currently holding all my crypto positions, waiting for them to hit their profit targets or stop-loss levels."

I need to decide for each coin whether to hold or close the position based on the invalidation conditions and current market data.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n1. **ETH**: \n   - Current price: 3798.15\n   - Entry price: 3696.6\n   - Unrealized PnL: +464.08\n   - Profit target: 4068.075\n   - Stop loss: 3513.3375\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 3650 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above entry and stop loss, but not yet at profit target. EMA20 is 3789.957, close to current price. MACD is positive at 7.156. RSI(7) is 60.895, which is not overbought yet. Funding rate is positive but small. No invalidation triggered. I should hold.\n\n2. **SOL**:\n   - Current price: 184.415\n   - Entry price: 179.93\n   - Unrealized PnL: +422.86\n   - Profit target: 197.8295\n   - Stop loss: 170.85275\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 178 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Current price is above entry and stop loss. EMA20 is 183.84, close. MACD is slightly positive at 0.402. RSI(7) is 63.315, not extreme. Funding positive. No invalidation. Hold.\n\n3. **XRP**:\n   - Current price: 2.43935\n   - Entry price: 2.44\n   - Unrealized PnL: -19.67 (slight loss)\n   - Profit target: 2.815\n   - Stop loss: 2.325\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Price is very close to entry, slightly below. EMA20 is 2.434, almost same. MACD is 0.003, flat. RSI(7) is 68.615, a bit high but not extreme. Funding positive. No invalidation triggered. I should hold as it's not hitting stop loss or profit target yet.\n\n4. **BTC**:\n   - Current price: 108510.5\n   - Entry price: 107343.0\n   - Unrealized PnL: +140.1\n   - Profit target: 118136.15\n   - Stop loss: 102026.675\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Price is above entry and stop loss. EMA20 is 108082.379, close. MACD is strongly positive at 176.548. RSI(7) is 79.454, which is overbought (>70), but RSI(14) is 70.389, also high. Funding positive. No invalidation. However, RSI is high, but since it's not hitting invalidation, I should hold. The profit target is still far, and the trend seems strong.\n\n5. **BNB**:\n   - Current price: 1077.45\n   - Entry price: 1084.99\n   - Unrealized PnL: -103.78 (loss)\n   - Profit target: 1188.332\n   - Stop loss: 1026.284\n   - Invalidation condition: If price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle.\n   - Price is below entry, but above stop loss. EMA20 is 1073.722, close to price. MACD is positive at 2.633. RSI(7) is 71.062, a bit overbought, but RSI(14) is 68.281. Funding is negative (-1.07454e-05), which is slightly bearish, but small. No invalidation triggered. I should hold.\n\nNow, for DOGE, I don't have a position, so I could consider entering if there's an opportunity. But I need to check if it's worth it.\n\nAvailable cash is 6133.56. I should only enter new trades if margin is at least 5% of available cash, which is 0.05 * 6133.56 ≈ 306.678 USD.\n\nLooking at DOGE data:\n- Current price: 0.182295\n- EMA20: 0.182, very close.\n- MACD: 0.001, flat.\n- RSI(7): 65.588, not extreme.\n- Funding rate: negative (-1.71636e-05), slightly bearish.\n- Longer-term: EMA20 (4h) is 0.191 vs 50-period 0.195, so below, indicating downtrend. MACD negative, RSI low at 35.404.\n\nNot a strong signal. Confidence would be low. Probably not worth entering.\n\nI have positions in all other coins, and no cash to enter new trades unless I close something, but I shouldn't close unless invalidation triggers.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin I have a position in, with 'hold' signal, and for DOGE, if I don't act, I don't need to output anything.\n\nFor 'hold', I need to provide the same quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd as per the existing position.\n\nFrom the account info, for each position, I have the details. I should use the same values for hold.\n\nFor ETH: quantity 4.57, profit_target 4068.075, stop_loss 3513.3375, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3650 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 844.825\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin with hold signal.\n\nAlso, for XRP, the sl_oid and tp_oid are -1, which might mean not set, but I should still hold.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, it should be one JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, for ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, BNB, I output hold.\n\nFor DOGE, no action.\n\nIn the output, I need to specify the trade_signal_args with all fields.\n\nLet me structure it.\n\nFirst, ETH:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 4.57,\n      \"profit_target\": 4068.075,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3513.3375,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 3650 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 844.825\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor SOL:\nquantity: 94.24\nprofit_target: 197.8295\nstop_loss: 170.85275\ninvalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 178 on a 3-minute candle\"\nleverage: 10\nconfidence: 0.7\nrisk_usd: 844.825\n\nFor XRP:\nquantity: 3609.0\nprofit_target: 2.815\nstop_loss: 2.325\ninvalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\"\nleverage: 10\nconfidence: 0.65\nrisk_usd: 442.032\n\nFor BTC:\nquantity: 0.12\nprofit_target: 118136.15\nstop_loss: 102026.675\ninvalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\"\nleverage: 10\nconfidence: 0.75\nrisk_usd: 619.2345\n\nFor BNB:\nquantity: 13.76\nprofit_target: 1188.332\nstop_loss: 1026.284\ninvalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\"\nleverage: 10\nconfidence: 0.65\nrisk_usd: 750.0\n\nI need to make sure the JSON is correct.\n\nAlso, for hold, there's no justification needed in the output, as per the example.\n\nIn the hold JSON example, it doesn't have \"justification\", only for entry and close.\n\nSo, for hold, I omit justification.\n\nNow, for DOGE, I'm not entering, so no output.\n\nFinally, output a JSON object with all these.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm riding the wave with ETH and SOL as they show strength, holding firm on BTC despite its overbought RSI, and keeping XRP, BNB, and BTC in play as they haven't hit their invalidation points yet. My current positions in ETH and SOL are performing well, contributing to my overall 41.01% return, with ETH up $464.08 and SOL up $422.86."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and decide whether to hold or close them based on their exit plans and current market conditions. Then, if there are no positions or if I want to enter new ones, I consider that. But I must not pyramid or increase size, so only new entries if flat.\n\nExisting positions:\n\n1. ETH: long, quantity 4.57, entry 3696.6, current 3827.25, up 597.07. Stop loss is 3513.3375, profit target 4068.075. Invalidation: if price closes below 3650 on 3-min candle. Current RSI is 83.403, which is overbought, but trend is up. EMA is below price, MACD positive. I should hold unless invalidation triggers. No invalidation yet, so hold.\n\n2. SOL: long, quantity 94.24, entry 179.93, current 185.065, up 484.12. Stop loss 170.85275, profit target 197.8295. Invalidation: if price closes below 178 on 3-min candle. Current RSI is 73.607, high but not extreme. Price above EMA, MACD positive. Hold.\n\n3. XRP: long, quantity 3609, entry 2.44, current 2.44965, up 17.5. Stop loss 2.325, profit target 2.815. Invalidation: if price closes below 2.30 on 3-min candle. Current RSI is 78.301, overbought. Price just above EMA, but RSI high. Invalidation is 2.30, current is 2.44965, so no trigger. Hold.\n\n4. BTC: long, quantity 0.12, entry 107343, current 108941.5, up 191.82. Stop loss 102026.675, profit target 118136.15. Invalidation: if price closes below 105000 on 3-min candle. Current RSI is 84.205, very overbought. Price above EMA, MACD positive but RSI extreme. Invalidation is 105000, current is 108941.5, so no trigger. But RSI high, might be caution. However, exit plan says hold unless invalidation. So hold.\n\n5. DOGE: short, quantity -100230, entry 0.18, current 0.183695, down -29.87. Stop loss 0.192755, profit target 0.165215. Invalidation: if price closes above 0.195 on 3-min candle. Current RSI is 83.698, overbought, which is bad for short. Price is rising, but invalidation is 0.195, current is 0.183695, so not triggered. But RSI high suggests potential reversal down? Or continuation? In short, I'm losing, but stop loss not hit. Invalidation not triggered. Should hold based on plan.\n\n6. BNB: long, quantity 13.76, entry 1084.99, current 1080.45, down -62.5. Stop loss 1026.284, profit target 1188.332. Invalidation: if price closes below 1000 on 3-min candle. Current RSI is 71.778, high. Price slightly below entry, but above stop loss. Invalidation far away. Hold.\n\nAll positions are within their exit plans, no invalidation triggers. So for all, I should output 'hold' with the current quantity, profit target, stop loss, invalidation condition, leverage, confidence, and risk_usd as per the existing data.\n\nNow, for new entries, I have available cash of 4291.75. I need to see if there are any opportunities to enter new positions. But I'm already in 6 positions, and the instructions say I can manage multiple, but I should not over-trade. Also, only enter if expected move exceeds trading costs.\n\nLook at each coin:\n\n- BTC: RSI very high at 84.205, might be due for pullback. But trend is up. Not a good entry now.\n\n- ETH: Similar, RSI 83.403, overbought.\n\n- SOL: RSI 73.607, high but not extreme.\n\n- BNB: RSI 71.778, high.\n\n- XRP: RSI 78.301, high.\n\n- DOGE: RSI 83.698, very high, and I'm already short, so not entering opposite.\n\nAll coins seem overbought in short term. Funding rates are small positives or negatives, not extreme.\n\nI should not enter any new positions because markets are overbought, and I already have positions. Also, available cash is 4291.75, which is about 30% of account value, but I have multiple positions open.\n\nThe instructions say: \"Do not even bother entering small positions that only use <5% of available cash on margin or risk_usd\". Available cash is 4291.75, 5% is about 214.59. But since I'm already in positions, and markets are overbought, better to hold existing.\n\nFor hold, I need to output JSON for each coin with signal 'hold', and include all the args: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI have the data from the account info.\n\nFor each position, the exit_plan has profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition. Also, leverage, confidence, risk_usd are given.\n\nSo for ETH:\n\n- coin: ETH\n\n- signal: hold\n\n- quantity: 4.57 (current size)\n\n- profit_target: 4068.075\n\n- stop_loss: 3513.3375\n\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3650 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\n- leverage: 10\n\n- confidence: 0.7\n\n- risk_usd: 844.825\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor DOGE, it's short, but quantity is negative, but in the output, for hold, I think I should use the absolute quantity or the current size as given. In the account info, quantity is -100230 for DOGE, which is short. But in the JSON output, for hold, it should be the full current size, which is negative for short. But looking at the example, for hold, it doesn't specify direction, but quantity should be the position size.\n\nIn the close_position example, it says \"quantity\": <full current size>, and for DOGE, it's negative. So I think for hold, I should use the quantity as is, negative for short.\n\nSimilarly, profit_target and stop_loss: for short, profit_target is below entry, stop_loss above.\n\nIn DOGE, profit_target is 0.165215, which is below entry 0.18, so for short, that's correct. Stop_loss is 0.192755, above entry.\n\nIn the JSON, for hold, I need to provide these.\n\nAlso, confidence and risk_usd are given.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to return a JSON object for each coin that I have a position in, with hold signal.\n\nI don't have any new entries to make, so only hold signals.\n\nFinally, output in compact JSON.\n\nLet me list all coins with their hold data.\n\nFrom account:\n\nETH: quantity 4.57, profit_target 4068.075, stop_loss 3513.3375, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3650 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 844.825\n\nSOL: quantity 94.24, profit_target 197.8295, stop_loss 170.85275, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 178 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 844.825\n\nXRP: quantity 3609.0, profit_target 2.815, stop_loss 2.325, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 442.032\n\nBTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity -100230.0, profit_target 0.165215, stop_loss 0.192755, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 920.034\n\nBNB: quantity 13.76, profit_target 1188.332, stop_loss 1026.284, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 750.0\n\nFor the JSON output, it should be a object with keys for each coin, and inside, trade_signal_args with the details.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with keys like \"ETH\", \"SOL\", etc., each containing another object with \"trade_signal_args\".\n\nAnd for hold, no justification needed in the JSON, according to the example for hold.\n\nIn the hold example, there is no \"justification\" field. Only for entry and close, there is justification.\n\nFor hold: \n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification for hold.\n\nFor close and entry, there is justification.\n\nSo for my case, all holds, no justification.\n\nNow, I need to output this for all six coins.\n\nAlso, ensure that for DOGE, quantity is negative.\n\nFinally, output the JSON.",

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. I must decide for each coin whether to hold or close the position based on the current market data and my exit conditions.\n\n- For ETH: I'm long with entry at 3696.6, current price 3851.65, profit target 4068.075, stop loss 3513.3375. Invalidation condition is if price closes below 3650 on a 3-minute candle. Current RSI is 50.271, which is neutral, and price is above EMA20 (3852.96 vs 3851.65, very close). MACD is negative but improving. The position is profitable, and nothing triggers invalidation yet. I should hold.\n\n- For SOL: Long, entry 179.93, current 184.715, profit target 197.8295, stop loss 170.85275. Invalidation if price closes below 178. Current RSI is 38.639, which is oversold, and price is below EMA20 (184.926 vs 184.715). MACD is negative. But the position is profitable, and invalidation not hit. Hold.\n\n- For XRP: Long, entry 2.44, current 2.49475, profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325. Invalidation if price closes below 2.30. Current RSI is 43.59, neutral, price is slightly below EMA20 (2.498 vs 2.49475). MACD negative. Position is profitable, no invalidation. Hold.\n\n- For BTC: Long, entry 107343.0, current 109738.5, profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675. Invalidation if price closes below 105000. Current RSI is 46.112, neutral, price is below EMA20 (109818.646 vs 109738.5). MACD negative but improving from -94.865 to -88.836. Position profitable, no invalidation. Hold.\n\n- For DOGE: Short, entry 0.18, current 0.183865, profit target 0.165215, stop loss 0.192755. Invalidation if price closes above 0.195. Current RSI is 61.709, which is high, and price is slightly below EMA20 (0.184 vs 0.183865). MACD is 0.0. The position is slightly losing, but not at stop or invalidation. I should hold.\n\n- For BNB: Long, entry 1082.1, current 1078.95, profit target 1185.17, stop loss 1023.59. Invalidation if price closes below 1000. Current RSI is 55.671, neutral to slightly bullish, price is very close to EMA20 (1078.895 vs 1078.95). MACD negative. Position is slightly losing, but not at stop or invalidation. Hold.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new trades. I have available cash of 3290.34. According to the rules, I should only enter if the expected move exceeds trading costs, and size based on confidence.\n\nLooking at the coins:\n\n- BTC: Price is consolidating, RSI neutral, MACD improving but still negative. Not a strong signal.\n\n- ETH: Similar, price near EMA, RSI 50, no strong trend.\n\n- SOL: Oversold RSI, price below EMA, might be a buying opportunity, but I'm already long.\n\n- BNB: Neutral, not compelling.\n\n- XRP: Neutral.\n\n- DOGE: RSI high, but I'm short, so might not want to add.\n\nI don't see any strong alpha signals for new entries. All coins are in a range or slight downtrend. My existing positions are mostly profitable and not hitting stops or invalidations.\n\nI should not enter any new trades. Only manage existing ones by holding.\n\nFor output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I have a position in, with signal 'hold', and include all the required fields: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nThe quantity should be the full current size from the account info.\n\nAlso, for each, I need to have a justification, but only for entries or closes. For hold, the JSON doesn't require a justification in the output, according to the examples. Looking back:\n\nFor hold: \n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification is mentioned for hold. But in the close example, there is a justification. So for hold, I don't need to add justification.\n\nIn the hold JSON, it's just the args without justification.\n\nNow, for each position, I need to output this.\n\nAlso, I must not narrate calculations, just output JSON.\n\nSo, for each coin: ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, I output a hold signal with the current parameters from the account info.\n\nThe account info has exit_plan which includes profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and also confidence, risk_usd, leverage.\n\nI should use those values.\n\nFor example, for ETH:\nquantity: 4.57\nprofit_target: 4068.075\nstop_loss: 3513.3375\ninvalidation_condition: 'If the price closes below 3650 on a 3-minute candle'\nleverage: 10\nconfidence: 0.7\nrisk_usd: 844.825\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON is correct.\n\nAlso, for DOGE, it's a short position, but the quantity is negative? In the account info, DOGE quantity is -100230.0, which indicates short. But in the output, for signal, it's still 'hold', and quantity should be the full size, which is negative for short, but the direction is handled downstream, so I think I just output the quantity as is.\n\nIn the output examples, for entry, quantity is positive regardless of direction, but for hold and close, it's the current size, which could be negative for short.\n\nIn the account, DOGE has quantity -100230.0, so I should use that.\n\nSimilarly, all other parameters.\n\nNow, I think I'm not entering any new trades, so only hold signals.\n\nFinally, output a JSON object for each coin.\n\nThe output should be a single JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, something like:\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"SOL\": { ... },\n  ...\n}\n\nAnd each inner object has \"trade_signal_args\" with the details.\n\nI need to ensure that for hold, no justification is included.\n\nAlso, confidence and risk_usd are from the account, which I have.\n\nI think that's it.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding my current positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, and DOGE as they are profitable or not yet hitting my stop-loss or invalidation conditions, and I'm seeing no strong new trading opportunities with this current market data.

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB.\n\n- ETH: Long, entry at 3696.6, current price 3729.25, unrealized PnL +149.21, profit target 4068.075, stop loss 3513.3375, invalidation if price closes below 3650 on 3-min candle. Confidence 0.7, risk_usd 844.825.\n\n- XRP: Long, entry at 2.44, current price 2.42725, unrealized PnL -63.34, profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325, invalidation if price closes below 2.30. Confidence 0.65, risk_usd 442.032.\n\n- BTC: Long, entry at 107343.0, current price 107919.5, unrealized PnL +69.18, profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation if price closes below 105000. Confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345.\n\n- DOGE: Short, entry at 0.18, current price 0.174685, unrealized PnL +873.2, profit target 0.165215, stop loss 0.192755, invalidation if price closes above 0.195. Confidence 0.7, risk_usd 920.034.\n\n- BNB: Long, entry at 1082.1, current price 1041.05, unrealized PnL -946.18, profit target 1185.17, stop loss 1023.59, invalidation if price closes below 1000. Confidence 0.7, risk_usd 500.\n\nAvailable cash is 4722.2, and account value is 12957.76.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each position based on the exit plans and invalidation conditions. I should only close a position if the invalidation condition is triggered or if there's a strong reason, but the instruction is to hold unless invalidation triggers.\n\nCheck for each coin:\n\n- ETH: Current price is 3729.25, invalidation if close below 3650. Latest price is 3729.25, and the last 10 prices: last few are around 3737, 3729. So it's above 3650, no invalidation. Hold.\n\n- XRP: Current price 2.42725, invalidation if close below 2.30. Last prices are around 2.42-2.43, above 2.30, so hold.\n\n- BTC: Current price 107919.5, invalidation if close below 105000. Last prices are around 108k, above 105000, so hold.\n\n- DOGE: Short position, current price 0.174685, invalidation if price closes above 0.195. Last prices are around 0.174-0.178, below 0.195, so hold.\n\n- BNB: Current price 1041.05, invalidation if close below 1000. Last prices are around 1041-1052, above 1000, so hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered, so I should hold all positions.\n\nNow, for any new trades: I have available cash of 4722.2, but I'm currently in several positions, and the instruction is to not enter small positions with <5% of available cash. 5% of 4722.2 is about 236.11. I need to see if there are any good opportunities to enter.\n\nI should analyze each coin for potential entries. But I'm already in multiple positions, so I need to be cautious about over-leveraging or adding more, but the instruction doesn't say I can't enter new positions; it just says for each coin, choose one action.\n\nFirst, look at the market data.\n\nBTC: Price 107919.5, EMA20 at 108341.624, so price is below EMA, RSI 7-period is 26.106, which is oversold. MACD is negative but less so. Funding rate positive 1.25e-05, small positive. Open interest average 30353.43, latest 30340.29, slightly down. Volume low (38.41 vs avg 4180.334), which might indicate lack of interest or consolidation. RSI on 4-hour is 50.143, not extreme. Could be a potential long if I think it will bounce, but I'm already long BTC with entry at 107343, and it's profitable, so maybe no need to add.\n\nETH: Similar, price 3729.25, EMA20 3758.48, below EMA, RSI 7-period 26.36, oversold. Funding rate negative -4.8072e-06, small negative. Open interest up a bit (489310.37 vs avg 482823.06). Volume low (32.076 vs avg 84481.444). I'm already long ETH, so probably hold.\n\nSOL: Price 177.305, EMA20 180.132, below EMA. RSI 7-period is extremely oversold at 9.505! That's very low. Funding rate positive 1.25e-05. Open interest slightly down (5102292.24 vs avg 5107248.4). Volume low (1516.24 vs avg 685558.937). RSI on 4-hour is 49.509, not extreme. But intraday RSI is super oversold, might be a good bounce candidate. I don't have a SOL position, so could consider entering long.\n\nBNB: I'm already long and underwater, price 1041.05, EMA20 1050.655, below EMA. RSI 7-period 16.624, oversold. Funding rate negative -1.73582e-05. Open interest down a bit (63265.54 vs avg 63458.54). Volume very low (7.193 vs avg 8568.342). But I'm already in a losing position, so probably not add.\n\nXRP: I'm long, price 2.42725, EMA20 2.442, slightly below. RSI 7-period 21.897, oversold. Funding rate negative -1.65304e-05. Open interest down (45341846.0 vs avg 46580249.8). Volume low (4101.0 vs avg 7301070.200). Hold.\n\nDOGE: I'm short, price 0.174685, EMA20 0.177, below EMA. RSI 7-period 14.737, oversold. Funding rate negative -1.83997e-05. Open interest down (596768318.0 vs avg 621502215.2). Volume low (9006.0 vs avg 76164687.308). Being short and oversold might be risky, but I'm profitable, and invalidation not hit.\n\nNow, SOL looks interesting because RSI is extremely oversold at 9.505, which is rare. Price is below EMA, but such low RSI might indicate a bounce. Funding is positive, which is good for long. Volume is low, but that might not matter. I could consider a long entry on SOL.\n\nAvailable cash is 4722.2. I need to size it appropriately.\n\nConfidence: RSI at 9.505 is very oversold, so I'm confident in a bounce. Let's say confidence around 0.8 (since it's extreme, but market could be bearish).\n\nMargin: At 0.8 confidence, I should use 20-40% of available cash. Available cash is 4722.2, so 20% is 944.44, 40% is 1888.88. I'll choose margin around 1500 USD.\n\nRisk_usd: Should be a fraction of margin, r in [0.2,0.8]. Let's say r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 1500 = 750 USD.\n\nLeverage: For SOL, max leverage is 20x. Minimum is 5x. I'll use 10x leverage to be conservative.\n\nEntry price: current_price = 177.305\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 1500 * 10 = 15000 USD\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 15000 / 177.305 ≈ 84.59 (let's calculate: 15000 / 177.305 = about 84.59)\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 750 / 84.59 ≈ 8.86 (since risk_usd is the dollar loss when stop is hit, and for long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance)\n\nProfit target: I need to set a profit target that is a multiple of stop_distance. Stop_distance is about 8.86, so say 2x or 3x. But I need to consider realistic moves.\n\nATR: 3-period ATR is 2.216, 14-period is 1.842. So a move of 8-9 might be large, but RSI is very oversold, so bounce could be sharp.\n\nI could set profit target at, say, 1.5 ATR above or something. EMA20 is at 180.132, so maybe target EMA20 or higher.\n\nSet profit target at 185, for example. Distance from entry: 185 - 177.305 = 7.695, which is less than stop_distance? No, stop_distance is 8.86, so profit distance is less than stop, which is not good; I need profit distance to be larger to cover risk.\n\nI need profit target such that |entry - profit_target| > stop_distance, ideally multiple.\n\nStop_distance is 8.86, so profit distance should be at least, say, 1.5x or 2x.\n\nSet profit target at entry_price + 2 * stop_distance = 177.305 + 2*8.86 = 177.305 + 17.72 = 195.025\n\nBut is that realistic? Current price 177, EMA20 180, 4-hour EMA20 is 187.207, so 195 might be too high, unlikely to hit soon.\n\nPerhaps I need to adjust risk or margin.\n\nMargin I set at 1500, risk_usd 750, leverage 10x.\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = margin * leverage / entry_price = 1500 * 10 / 177.305 ≈ 15000 / 177.305 ≈ 84.59\n\nStop_distance = 750 / 84.59 ≈ 8.86\n\nFor long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 177.305 - 8.86 = 168.445\n\nNow, profit target: I want it to be a multiple, say 2x risk, so profit target should give profit of 2 * risk_usd = 1500 USD? No.\n\nrisk_usd is the amount I lose if stop hit, which is 750.\n\nFor profit, if I want reward:risk = 2:1, then profit should be 2 * risk_usd = 1500 USD profit.\n\nProfit per unit = profit_target - entry_price\n\nTotal profit = quantity * (profit_target - entry_price) = 1500\n\nSo 84.59 * (profit_target - 177.305) = 1500\n\nprofit_target - 177.305 = 1500 / 84.59 ≈ 17.73\n\nprofit_target = 177.305 + 17.73 = 195.035\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut is 195 realistic? Looking at history, prices were around 180 recently, 4-hour EMA is 187, so 195 might be a stretch, but possible if bounce.\n\nRSI is very oversold, so a bounce to 185 or 190 could happen.\n\nI could set a closer profit target, but then reward:risk might be less.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Profit distance |entry_price - profit_target| should be a multiple of stop_distance.\"\n\nstop_distance is 8.86, so for multiple, say 2x, profit distance 17.72, so profit_target = 177.305 + 17.72 = 195.025\n\nAnd invalidate if something, say if RSI goes above 70 or price breaks below a key level.\n\nInvalidation condition: for long, if price closes below stop_loss or something else, but I already have stop_loss.\n\nThe invalidation_condition is additional, like if the thesis is invalidated.\n\nFor this trade, thesis is oversold bounce, so invalidation could be if price drops further without bouncing, but stop_loss should handle that.\n\nI could set invalidation if RSI remains low or something.\n\nBut to keep it simple, invalidation if price closes below 168 (which is below stop_loss, but stop_loss might hit first).\n\nPerhaps invalidation if the 4-hour RSI drops below 40 or something, but I need specific.\n\nLook at the data: current RSI 7-period is 9.505, very low. Invalidation could be if RSI 7-period goes above 50, meaning it's no longer oversold, but that might be good for profit.\n\nNo, for a bounce trade, I want it to bounce, so invalidation should be if the downtrend continues.\n\nPerhaps if price closes below the recent low or something.\n\nRecent low in the 10 prices: the last price is 177.305, previous are 177.88, 178.675, etc., min of the last 10 is 177.305? No, the prices: [180.3, 180.185, 179.515, 179.665, 179.53, 179.33, 178.815, 178.675, 177.88, 177.305] so min is 177.305, but it's the current, so support might be there.\n\nI could set invalidation if price closes below 175 on 3-minute candle, for example.\n\nBut stop_loss is at 168.445, which is lower.\n\nI need to make sure stop_loss is reasonable.\n\nATR 14-period is 1.842, so stop_distance of 8.86 is about 4.8 ATR, which is large, might be too wide.\n\nI should adjust the sizing.\n\nPerhaps use a smaller stop based on ATR.\n\nFor example, set stop_loss at entry_price - 2 * ATR = 177.305 - 2*1.842 = 177.305 - 3.684 = 173.621\n\nThen stop_distance = 3.684\n\nrisk_usd = stop_distance * quantity\n\nBut I need to set risk_usd first.\n\nConfidence high, say 0.8, margin 1500, risk_usd = r * margin, r=0.5, so risk_usd=750\n\nThen quantity = notional / entry_price = 1500 * leverage / 177.305\n\nLeverage, say 10x, notional=15000, quantity=15000/177.305≈84.59\n\nThen stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 750 / 84.59 ≈ 8.86, which is large.\n\nTo have smaller stop, I need smaller risk_usd or larger quantity, but quantity is fixed by notional.\n\nIf I want stop_distance based on ATR, say 2 ATR = 3.684, then risk_usd = stop_distance * quantity = 3.684 * 84.59 ≈ 311.66\n\nThen r = risk_usd / margin = 311.66 / 1500 ≈ 0.208, which is within [0.2,0.8], ok.\n\nThen profit target: multiple of stop_distance, say 3x, profit distance = 3 * 3.684 = 11.052, profit_target = 177.305 + 11.052 = 188.357\n\nWhich is closer to EMA20 at 180.132 and 4-hour EMA20 at 187.207, more realistic.\n\nReward:risk ratio: profit per unit 11.052, risk per unit 3.684, so 3:1, good.\n\nrisk_usd is 311.66, profit usd = quantity * profit per unit = 84.59 * 11.052 ≈ 934.66, which is about 3x risk_usd? 311.66 * 3 = 934.98, yes.\n\nBut risk_usd is the amount risked, so reward is 934.66 for risk of 311.66, ratio about 3.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for invalidation, I can set if price closes below 175 or something, but stop_loss is at 173.621, so invalidation could be if RSI 7-period goes above 50, indicating bounce is over, but I might want to hold until profit target.\n\nThe invalidation_condition is for early exit if thesis invalid, not for stop loss.\n\nFor example, if the oversold condition is no longer present, but since I have a profit target, I might not need it.\n\nI can set invalidation if price breaks below a support level, but stop_loss should handle it.\n\nTo be safe, set invalidation if price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle, which is below stop_loss, so unlikely.\n\nPerhaps no additional invalidation, just use stop_loss and profit target.\n\nBut the output requires invalidation_condition, so I need to provide something.\n\nFor SOL, current RSI very low, invalidation could be if the 4-hour RSI drops below 40, indicating continued bearishness, but 4-hour RSI is 49.509, not below 40.\n\nCurrent 4-hour RSI is 49.509, which is neutral.\n\nI can set invalidation if the daily trend changes or something, but I don't have daily data.\n\nPerhaps based on intraday: if price closes below the 20-period EMA on 4-hour, but 4-hour EMA20 is 187.207, price is 177, already below.\n\nNot good.\n\nI can set invalidation if the MACD on 4-hour turns positive or something, but MACD is negative.\n\n4-hour MACD: [-2.37, -2.308, -2.237, -2.146, -2.137, -1.895, -1.835, -1.939, -1.988, -1.691] , latest -1.691, still negative.\n\nPerhaps invalidation if 4-hour RSI drops below 45 or something.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll set invalidation if price closes below 170 on 3-minute candle, which is below my stop_loss of 173.621, so it might not hit, but it's a condition.\n\nNow, for confidence, I said 0.8.\n\nLeverage 10x for SOL, max is 20x, so 10x is fine.\n\nNow, I need to decide if I should enter SOL.\n\nI have available cash 4722.2, and margin 1500 is about 31.7% of available cash, which is within 20-40% for confidence 0.8, ok.\n\nRisk_usd 311.66, which is less than margin.\n\nNow, for other coins, I'm already in positions, so I should hold them.\n\nBut I need to output JSON for each coin I act on or have position in.\n\nSo for existing positions: ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, I need to output hold signals with their current quantities and exit plans.\n\nFor SOL, if I enter, I need to output buy_to_enter.\n\nBut I should check if there are other opportunities.\n\nBNB is oversold, but I'm already long and losing, so probably not add.\n\nDOGE is short and profitable, oversold, but as short, oversold might mean bounce, but I'm short, so if it bounces, I lose, but my invalidation is above 0.195, current 0.174, so still ok.\n\nXRP and BTC are also oversold, but I'm long, so hold.\n\nETH similar.\n\nSOL seems the best candidate for new entry.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide JSON for each coin.\n\nFirst, for existing positions, hold with their current quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd from the account info.\n\nIn the account info, for each position, it has exit_plan with profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and confidence, risk_usd.\n\nFor hold, I need to output those values.\n\nSimilarly for close, but I'm not closing.\n\nFor SOL entry, I need to calculate.\n\nBut in the output, for hold, it should be the same as before, I think, unless I want to change, but the instruction is to check exit plans, and if not invalidated, hold.\n\nI don't need to change the exit plans for existing positions unless I decide to close early, which I'm not.\n\nSo for hold, I can use the existing profit_target, stop_loss, etc.\n\nNow, for SOL entry.\n\nLet's finalize the numbers.\n\nConfidence: 0.8 (since extreme oversold)\n\nMargin: 30% of available cash = 0.3 * 4722.2 = 1416.66, say 1400 USD to be round.\n\nAvailable cash is 4722.2, 30% is about 1416.66.\n\nRisk_usd: r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 1400 = 700 USD? But earlier I thought of smaller stop.\n\nI want a tighter stop based on ATR.\n\nATR 14-period is 1.842, so set stop_distance = 2 * ATR = 2 * 1.842 = 3.684\n\nThen for long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 177.305 - 3.684 = 173.621\n\nNow, risk_usd = stop_distance * quantity\n\nBut quantity depends on leverage.\n\nLeverage: use 10x.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 1400 * 10 = 14000 USD\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 14000 / 177.305 ≈ 78.96\n\nThen risk_usd = stop_distance * quantity = 3.684 * 78.96 ≈ 290.99 USD\n\nThen r = risk_usd / margin = 290.99 / 1400 ≈ 0.208, within range.\n\nProfit target: set multiple of stop_distance, say 3x, so profit_distance = 3 * 3.684 = 11.052\n\nProfit_target = entry_price + profit_distance = 177.305 + 11.052 = 188.357\n\nReward:risk ratio good.\n\nInvalidation_condition: for example, \"If the price closes below 170 on a 3-minute candle\" or \"If the 4-hour RSI drops below 40\"\n\nBut 4-hour RSI is 49.509, not below 40.\n\nPerhaps \"If the MACD on 4-hour turns positive\" but it's negative.\n\nTo avoid overcomplicating, \"If the price closes below 173 (stop_loss level) on a 3-minute candle\" but stop_loss is already there.\n\nThe invalidation_condition is for early exit if thesis invalid, not necessarily the stop.\n\nFor example, if the oversold condition is no longer true, but RSI might go up.\n\nPerhaps \"If the RSI 7-period rises above 50 without the price reaching profit target\" but that might be vague.\n\nI can set \"If the price fails to bounce and closes below 175 on increasing volume\" but I don't have volume data in real-time.\n\nLook at the volume: current volume is 1516.24 vs avg 685558.937, which is very low, so volume is low, which might indicate lack of selling pressure or lack of interest.\n\nPerhaps invalidation if volume spikes down or something.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll set invalidation_condition to \"If the price closes below 170 on a 3-minute candle\" which is below stop_loss, so it might not happen, but it's a condition.\n\nNow, confidence 0.8.\n\nLeverage 10x.\n\nRisk_usd 290.99\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide JSON for each coin.\n\nCoins I have positions in: ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB → hold\n\nSOL → buy_to_enter\n\nOther coins: no action.\n\nNow, for hold, I need to output the current quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd from the account info.\n\nIn the account info, for each position, it has those values.\n\nFor example, for ETH: quantity 4.57, profit_target 4068.075, stop_loss 3513.3375, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3650 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 844.825\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor DOGE, it's short, but in the output, for hold, I still provide the same.\n\nNow, for SOL entry.\n\nSignal: buy_to_enter\n\nQuantity: 78.96 (calculated)\n\nProfit_target: 188.357\n\nStop_loss: 173.621\n\nInvalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 170 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nLeverage: 10\n\nConfidence: 0.8\n\nRisk_usd: 290.99\n\nJustification: for entry, I need 1-4 sentences.\n\n\"SOL is extremely oversold with RSI 7-period at 9.505, indicating a high probability of a bounce. Funding rate is positive, and price is below EMA, suggesting a potential reversal. I expect a move to 188.357 based on 3x ATR reward with tight stop.\"\n\nSomething like that.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to have one JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo the output should be a JSON object like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"XRP\": { ... },\n  \"BTC\": { ... },\n  \"DOGE\": { ... },\n  \"BNB\": { ... },\n  \"SOL\": { ... }\n}\n\nFor the coins I hold, signal \"hold\", for SOL, \"buy_to_enter\".\n\nIn the hold case, I don't need justification, only for entry and close.\n\nIn the output format, for hold, it doesn't have justification, but for entry and close, it does.\n\nLook back:\n\nFor hold: \n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification for hold.\n\nFor entry and close, there is justification.\n\nSo for existing positions, I output hold without justification.\n\nFor SOL, with justification.\n\nNow, finally, I need to make sure that for SOL, I'm not entering with less than 5% margin. Margin is 1400, available cash 4722.2, 5% is 236.11, so 1400 > 236, ok.\n\nAlso, risk_usd < margin, 290.99 < 1400, ok.\n\nLeverage min 5, max for SOL 20, 10 is ok.\n\nNow, write the JSON.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I’m currently holding all my positions, including ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB, as none of their invalidation conditions have been met, and I'm seeing an extremely oversold signal on SOL with its 7-period RSI at 9.505, leading me to enter a new long position expecting a bounce towards my target of 188.357. My rationale for SOL is that the oversold conditions and positive funding rate suggest a potential reversal, and I've set a tight stop-loss at 173.621 to manage my risk effectively on this trade."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. All are open, and I need to decide whether to hold or close them based on the current market data and my invalidation conditions.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n- **ETH**: Long position. Current price 3727.45, entry price 3696.6. PnL positive. Invalidation condition: price closes below 3650 on 3-min candle. Current price is above 3650, so no invalidation. RSI is very low at 24.013, which is oversold, but still in downtrend. EMA20 is 3755.402, above current price, indicating possible resistance. MACD is negative but not worsening drastically. I should hold unless invalidation triggers.\n\n- **SOL**: Long position. Current price 176.905, entry price 177.22. PnL negative. Invalidation condition: price closes below 170 on 3-min candle. Current price is above 170, so no invalidation. RSI is extremely low at 8.222, deeply oversold. EMA20 is 179.826, above current price. MACD negative. Might be a good time to add, but I can't pyramid, so I must hold or close. Since no invalidation, I should hold.\n\n- **XRP**: Long position. Current price 2.42715, entry price 2.44. PnL negative. Invalidation condition: price closes below 2.30 on 3-min candle. Current price is above 2.30, so no invalidation. RSI is 22.836, oversold. EMA20 is 2.44, almost at current price. MACD negative. Hold.\n\n- **BTC**: Long position. Current price 107855.5, entry price 107343.0. PnL positive. Invalidation condition: price closes below 105000 on 3-min candle. Current price is well above 105000, so no invalidation. RSI is 24.21, oversold. EMA20 is 108296.36, above current price. MACD negative. Hold.\n\n- **DOGE**: Short position. Current price 0.174095, entry price 0.18. PnL positive. Invalidation condition: price closes above 0.195 on 3-min candle. Current price is below 0.195, so no invalidation. RSI is 12.193, very oversold, which might suggest a bounce, but since I'm short, it's good. EMA20 is 0.177, above current price, supporting downtrend. Hold.\n\n- **BNB**: Long position. Current price 1042.15, entry price 1082.1. PnL negative. Invalidation condition: price closes below 1000 on 3-min candle. Current price is above 1000, so no invalidation. RSI is 26.491, oversold. EMA20 is 1049.878, above current price. MACD negative. Hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered. For all positions, I should signal 'hold'. I don't need to enter new trades because I'm already in multiple positions, and I shouldn't over-trade. Also, available cash is 3318.98, which is about 25% of account value, but since I'm holding existing positions, I shouldn't add new ones unless there's a compelling reason, but the instructions say no pyramiding, so for coins I'm already in, I can only hold or close.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I'm acting on. Since I'm holding all, I need to output 'hold' for each with the current quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, and risk_usd from the existing positions.\n\nI need to make sure the values are correct. From the account info:\n\n- ETH: quantity 4.57, profit_target 4068.075, stop_loss 3513.3375, invalidation_condition 'If the price closes below 3650 on a 3-minute candle', leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 844.825\n\n- SOL: quantity 79.18, profit_target 188.357, stop_loss 173.621, invalidation_condition 'If the price closes below 170 on a 3-minute candle', leverage 10, confidence 0.8, risk_usd 290.99\n\n- XRP: quantity 3609.0, profit_target 2.815, stop_loss 2.325, invalidation_condition 'If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle', leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 442.032\n\n- BTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition 'If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\n- DOGE: quantity -100230.0 (negative for short), profit_target 0.165215, stop_loss 0.192755, invalidation_condition 'If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle', leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 920.034\n\n- BNB: quantity 23.05, profit_target 1185.17, stop_loss 1023.59, invalidation_condition 'If the price closes below 1000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 500\n\nFor 'hold' signals, I don't need to change these values; I just output them as is.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with each coin and its trade_signal_args.\n\nAlso, note that for DOGE, the quantity is negative, but in the JSON, for 'hold' or 'close', I need to output the full current size, which is negative for short positions. The signal is still 'hold', and quantity should be the absolute value or the signed value? Looking at the examples, in 'close_position' and 'hold', it says \"quantity\": <full current size>, and in the account info, it's given with sign for DOGE being negative. So I should output the signed quantity.\n\nIn the JSON output for 'hold', it should be the same as the current position.\n\nNow, is there any coin I should close due to invalidation? I checked, none are triggered.\n\nIs there any new coin I want to enter? I'm already in all tradable coins except possibly, but all are covered. Tradable tokens are ['ETH','SOL','XRP','BTC','DOGE','BNB'], and I have positions in all, so no new entries.\n\nTherefore, for this invocation, I should output 'hold' for all six coins.\n\nFinally, output the JSON.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding my positions because none of the invalidation conditions have been met, and I'm aiming for profit targets across ETH, DOGE, and BNB while managing risk on the others. My ETH trade is showing early gains, but I'm closely watching its invalidation condition around 3650, while my DOGE short is performing well with a strong positive PnL, defying oversold RSI signals."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, and DOGE. For each, I should decide whether to hold or close based on their current state and the market data.\n\nList of existing positions:\n\n- ETH: Quantity 4.57, entry 3696.6, current 3707.35, PnL +49.13. Exit plan: profit target 4068.075, stop loss 3513.3375, invalidation below 3650. Confidence 0.7, risk_usd 844.825.\n\n- SOL: Quantity 79.18, entry 177.22, current 175.585, PnL -129.46. Exit plan: profit target 188.357, stop loss 173.621, invalidation below 170. Confidence 0.8, risk_usd 290.99.\n\n- XRP: Quantity 3609, entry 2.44, current 2.40235, PnL -153.2. Exit plan: profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325, invalidation below 2.30. Confidence 0.65, risk_usd 442.032.\n\n- BTC: Quantity 0.12, entry 107343, current 107426.5, PnL +10.02. Exit plan: profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation below 105000. Confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345.\n\n- DOGE: Quantity -100230 (short), entry 0.18, current 0.1728, PnL +1062.14. Exit plan: profit target 0.165215, stop loss 0.192755, invalidation above 0.195. Confidence 0.7, risk_usd 920.034.\n\nNow, I need to check if any invalidation conditions are met or if I should reconsider based on new data.\n\nLooking at current market data:\n\n- BTC: Current price 107426.5, EMA20 107462.453, MACD negative, RSI 51.6. Price is slightly below EMA20, but not by much. Invalidation condition is price below 105000, which is not hit. PnL is positive. I should hold.\n\n- ETH: Current price 3707.35, EMA20 3721.54, price below EMA, RSI 41.15, which is bearish but not oversold. Invalidation below 3650, current price 3707 > 3650, so not invalidated. PnL is positive. Hold.\n\n- SOL: Current price 175.585, EMA20 176.066, price below EMA, RSI 49.36, MACD negative. PnL negative, but not a huge loss. Invalidation below 170, current 175.585 > 170, so not invalidated. Hold.\n\n- XRP: Current price 2.40235, EMA20 2.416, price below EMA, RSI 37.07, which is approaching oversold. PnL negative. Invalidation below 2.30, current 2.40235 > 2.30, so not invalidated. Hold.\n\n- DOGE: Short position, current price 0.1728, EMA20 0.174, price below EMA, RSI 43.05. PnL is positive. Invalidation above 0.195, current 0.1728 < 0.195, so not invalidated. Hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered, so I should hold all positions.\n\nI also need to check if there are any new opportunities to enter trades. Available cash is 4465.07, which is decent. I need to see if any coin presents a good entry signal.\n\nFirst, review each coin's data:\n\n- BTC: Price 107426.5, EMA20 107462.453, slightly below EMA. MACD negative but improving (from -124 to -111). RSI 51.6, which is neutral. 4-hour EMA bearish (20 < 50), ATR high. Not a strong signal for entry. Funding positive, OI stable. Probably no new entry.\n\n- ETH: Price 3707.35, EMA20 3721.54, below EMA. MACD negative, RSI 41.15, bearish. 4-hour bearish. Funding slightly negative. I'm already long ETH, so no new entry.\n\n- SOL: Price 175.585, EMA20 176.066, below EMA. MACD negative, RSI 49.36. 4-hour bearish. Already long, no new entry.\n\n- BNB: Current price 1029.35, EMA20 1035.42, below EMA. MACD -2.88 negative, RSI 38.53, which is bearish and near oversold. 4-hour EMA bearish (20 < 50), RSI 38.675. Funding positive. Might be an opportunity to go long if oversold, but RSI is not extremely low. Let's check the intraday RSI series: recent low was 17.292, now 38.531, so it bounced but still below 50. Not a strong buy signal yet.\n\n- XRP: Already long, no new entry.\n\n- DOGE: Already short, no new entry.\n\nFor BNB, RSI 38.53 on 7-period, and 38.675 on 14-period, both below 40, suggesting oversold. Price is below EMA20. MACD negative. But to enter, I need a clear signal. The recent low in RSI was 17.292, which is very oversold, but it has recovered to 38.5, so maybe not the best entry point now.\n\nLooking at XRP for potential, but I'm already long.\n\nFor new entries, I need to see a strong alpha signal. None of the coins show a clear trend reversal or strong momentum.\n\nI should only enter if I'm confident. BNB might be a weak buy, but confidence might be low. Let's say confidence for BNB long is 0.6, so margin could be 10-20% of available cash.\n\nAvailable cash: 4465.07. 10% is 446.5, 20% is 893. So margin around 500-900 USD.\n\nRisk_usd should be a fraction, say 0.5 of margin, so risk_usd around 250-450.\n\nLeverage: BNB max leverage is 10x, so use 10x for capital efficiency.\n\nEntry price: current 1029.35\n\nNotional = margin * leverage\n\nBut I need profit target and stop loss.\n\nFirst, set stop loss. For a long position, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance, and stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price\n\nI need to define margin first.\n\nSuppose confidence 0.6, so margin = 15% of available cash = 0.15 * 4465.07 ≈ 669.76 USD\n\nLeverage = 10 (max for BNB)\n\nNotional = 669.76 * 10 = 6697.6 USD\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 6697.6 / 1029.35 ≈ 6.506\n\nRisk_usd: let's set r = 0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * margin = 0.5 * 669.76 ≈ 334.88 USD\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 334.88 / 6.506 ≈ 51.45 (approximately)\n\nSo stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 1029.35 - 51.45 ≈ 977.9\n\nProfit target should be a multiple of stop_distance. Say, 2x or 3x. If I set profit target with a ratio, e.g., risk-reward ratio 2:1, so profit distance = 2 * stop_distance = 2 * 51.45 ≈ 102.9, so profit_target = entry_price + profit_distance = 1029.35 + 102.9 ≈ 1132.25\n\nBut I need to make it realistic. Look at EMAs: 20-period EMA is 1035.42, 50-period EMA 1098.441, so above that might be resistance.\n\nProfit target should be based on resistance levels. 4-hour EMA50 is 1098.441, so maybe set profit target around 1100.\n\nIn the exit plan for new trade, profit target should capture upside.\n\nInvalidation condition: for long, if price closes below a certain level, say below EMA20 or something.\n\nCurrent EMA20 is 1035.42, so if price drops below that, it might invalidate the trade.\n\nBut I need a specific condition.\n\nPerhaps if price closes below 1000 on 3-minute candle.\n\nNow, justification: BNB is oversold with RSI below 40, price below EMA20, potential bounce. But is it strong? RSI was very low and recovered a bit, so maybe not the best entry.\n\nMACD is still negative.\n\nPerhaps wait for better signal.\n\nFor other coins, no clear signals.\n\nI am considering closing some positions, but invalidation not hit.\n\nSOL has negative PnL, but invalidation not hit.\n\nXRP negative PnL, not invalidated.\n\nI should hold all existing positions.\n\nFor new entries, BNB might be a candidate, but confidence is not high. Let's say confidence 0.6.\n\nBut the instruction is to only enter if expected move exceeds trading costs significantly.\n\nTrading costs: round-trip 0.09%, plus funding. For BNB, funding is positive 1.25e-05, which is low.\n\nStop distance is about 51.45, which is about 5% drop (51.45/1029.35≈0.05), so to cover costs, profit needs to be more.\n\nBut with risk-reward 2:1, it might be ok.\n\nBut is the signal strong? RSI is recovering from oversold, but not confirmed.\n\nPerhaps I should not enter BNB now.\n\nSimilarly, no other coins show strong signals.\n\nDOGE is already short and doing well.\n\nSo, I think for this invocation, I should hold all existing positions and not enter any new trades.\n\nOutput JSON for each coin with hold signal.\n\nFor hold, I need to output the current position details: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd from the existing position.\n\nIn the output for hold, I need to include all those fields.\n\nSimilarly for close, but I'm not closing.\n\nSo for each coin: ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, output hold with their current exit plan values.\n\nNow, for the JSON structure.\n\nI need to output a JSON object for each coin.\n\nThe output should be a single JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nLike: {\"ETH\": { \"trade_signal_args\": { ... } }, \"SOL\": { ... }, etc.}\n\nAnd for hold, signal is \"hold\", and include all fields.\n\nConfidence and risk_usd should be from the position, I think, or should I reassess?\n\nThe instruction says: for hold, supply the json with signal \"hold\", and the quantity, profit_target, etc. from the existing position.\n\nIn the account info, I have the exit plan with profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and also confidence and risk_usd.\n\nSo I should use those values.\n\nFor example, for ETH:\n\n\"trade_signal_args\": {\n  \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n  \"signal\": \"hold\",\n  \"quantity\": 4.57,\n  \"profit_target\": 4068.075,\n  \"stop_loss\": 3513.3375,\n  \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 3650 on a 3-minute candle\",\n  \"leverage\": 10,\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"risk_usd\": 844.825\n}\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to make sure the values are correct.\n\nIn the account info, for XRP, stop_loss is 2.325, profit_target 2.815, etc.\n\nFor DOGE, since it's short, stop_loss is 0.192755, which is above entry, and profit_target 0.165215 below.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for coins I'm not in, like BNB, I don't output anything, only for coins I have positions or act on.\n\nI'm not acting on BNB, so no output for BNB.\n\nSo only ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE.\n\nFinally, output the JSON.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding my positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, and DOGE as none of their invalidation conditions have been met, and I'm not seeing strong enough signals to initiate new trades despite having over $4,400 in available cash. The current market conditions suggest a sideways trend for most assets, and I'm waiting for clearer opportunities rather than chasing uncertain moves, especially with the overall account return being a healthy 21.89%."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. I must decide for each coin whether to hold or close the position based on the current market data and my exit conditions.\n\nLet me review each position:\n\n- **ETH**: I'm long with entry at 3696.6, current price 3699.15, so slightly up. Exit plan has profit target at 4068.075 and stop loss at 3513.3375. Invalidation condition is if price closes below 3650 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is above that, and RSI is low at 24.735, which might indicate oversold, but I need to see if invalidation is triggered. Price is above 3650, so no invalidation. MACD is negative but improving? Looking at intraday MACD: it's been negative and decreasing, from -0.094 to -3.776, so bearish momentum. However, RSI is very low, which could mean a bounce. But my exit plan is based on invalidation or stop/profit. Since neither is hit, I should hold unless invalidation triggers. Current price is 3699.15, which is above 3650, so no invalidation. I'll hold.\n\n- **SOL**: I'm long with entry at 177.22, current price 175.495, so down. Exit plan: profit target 188.357, stop loss 173.621, invalidation if price closes below 170. Current price is 175.495, above 170, so no invalidation. Stop loss is 173.621, and current price is above that, so not hit. RSI is 31.747, low, MACD negative but small. I should hold.\n\n- **XRP**: Long with entry at 2.44, current price 2.40665, down. Exit plan: profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325, invalidation if price closes below 2.30. Current price is 2.40665, above 2.30, so no invalidation. Stop loss not hit. RSI is 33.637, low. MACD is 0.0, neutral. I should hold.\n\n- **BTC**: Long with entry at 107343.0, current price 107199.5, down. Exit plan: profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation if price closes below 105000. Current price is 107199.5, well above 105000, so no invalidation. Stop loss not hit. RSI is 26.355, very low, MACD negative. I should hold.\n\n- **DOGE**: I'm short with entry at 0.18, current price 0.172995, so up (since short). Exit plan: profit target 0.165215, stop loss 0.192755, invalidation if price closes above 0.195. Current price is 0.172995, below 0.195, so no invalidation. Stop loss not hit. Profit target is 0.165215, current is 0.172995, so not yet. RSI is 29.976, low. I should hold.\n\n- **BNB**: Long with entry at 1024.8, current price 1024.95, slightly up. Exit plan: profit target 1126.46, stop loss 972.85, invalidation if price closes below 950. Current price is 1024.95, above 950, so no invalidation. Stop loss not hit. RSI is 24.855, very low. I should hold.\n\nNow, for any new entries, I need to see if there are opportunities. But I already have positions in all coins, so I can't enter new ones in the same coins because of no pyramiding. The instruction says: \"If you see a big opportunity, size it correctly on entry, because you wont be able to scale up your position on that name.\" Since I have positions in all, I should only manage existing ones, not enter new ones.\n\nAvailable cash is 3794.85, but I'm already using leverage in all positions, so I might not have margin for new entries, but since I'm flat in no coins, I shouldn't enter any new trades.\n\nThe coins are ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB – I have positions in all, so no coin is flat. Therefore, for this invocation, I should only output hold or close for each coin, but based on my analysis, none of the invalidation conditions are triggered, and stops/profits aren't hit, so I should hold all positions.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin with the signal 'hold', and include all the required fields: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI have these values from the current positions. For example, for ETH, quantity is 4.57, profit_target 4068.075, stop_loss 3513.3375, invalidation_condition as per exit plan, leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 844.825.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI should use the exact values from the current positions because they are already set.\n\nThe output should be in the 'hold' format.\n\nAlso, for DOGE, I'm short, but the quantity is negative, but in the JSON, for hold, I need to put the full current size, which is given as quantity, so for DOGE, it's -100230.0, but in the JSON, it should be a float, so I can use that.\n\nIn the hold JSON, signal is 'hold', and quantity is the full current size.\n\nNow, for the justification, in hold, it's not required to have justification, only for entry and close. Look back at the instructions:\n\nFor hold: \n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification field for hold, only for entry and close.\n\nSimilarly, for close, justification is required.\n\nBut for hold, no justification.\n\nSo for each coin, I'll output hold with the current values.\n\nNow, is there any reason to close any position? Let's check if invalidation is close or something.\n\nFor ETH: current price 3699.15, invalidation below 3650, not hit.\n\nSOL: current 175.495, invalidation below 170, not hit.\n\nXRP: current 2.40665, invalidation below 2.30, not hit.\n\nBTC: current 107199.5, invalidation below 105000, not hit.\n\nDOGE: current 0.172995, invalidation above 0.195, not hit.\n\nBNB: current 1024.95, invalidation below 950, not hit.\n\nAlso, RSI is low for all, which might indicate oversold, but since I'm long in most, it could be a buying opportunity, but I can't add because of no pyramiding. For DOGE short, low RSI might mean it's oversold and could bounce, but I'm short, so if it bounces, it might go against me, but invalidation is at 0.195, which is higher, so still safe.\n\nMACD is negative for most, showing bearish momentum, but my stops are not hit.\n\nI think I should hold all.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to output JSON for each coin.\n\nThe JSON should be a single object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, something like:\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"SOL\": { ... },\n  ...\n}\n\nAnd for each, the trade_signal_args.\n\nI need to use the exact values from the current positions.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\nFrom account info:\n\nETH: quantity=4.57, profit_target=4068.075, stop_loss=3513.3375, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 3650 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.7, risk_usd=844.825\n\nSOL: quantity=79.18, profit_target=188.357, stop_loss=173.621, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 170 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.8, risk_usd=290.99\n\nXRP: quantity=3609.0, profit_target=2.815, stop_loss=2.325, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=442.032\n\nBTC: quantity=0.12, profit_target=118136.15, stop_loss=102026.675, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.75, risk_usd=619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity=-100230.0, profit_target=0.165215, stop_loss=0.192755, invalidation_condition='If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.7, risk_usd=920.034\n\nBNB: quantity=6.54, profit_target=1126.46, stop_loss=972.85, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 950 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=335.0\n\nI should use these values in the output.\n\nFor DOGE, since it's short, the profit_target and stop_loss might be set correctly, but in the JSON, it's just numbers.\n\nAlso, confidence and risk_usd are given.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to make sure the JSON is correct.\n\nFinally, since no new entries, I only output for existing positions.\n\nSo, the output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin, and each value is another object with trade_signal_args.\n\nI think that's it.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding all my current positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB because none of my stop-loss, profit-target, or invalidation conditions have been met. My current strategy focuses on maintaining these positions as market conditions haven't triggered any exit plans, allowing me to ride out the current volatility while keeping my risk management parameters in place."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in XRP, BTC, and DOGE.\n\nFor XRP:\n- I'm long with 3609 quantity, entry at 2.44, current price 2.33765, so down.\n- Exit plan: profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325, invalidation if price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle.\n- Current price is 2.33765, which is above the stop loss of 2.325. The invalidation condition is below 2.30, and current is above that. So, no trigger to close yet. I should hold unless something changes.\n\nFor BTC:\n- Long with 0.12 quantity, entry at 107343, current 105859.5, down.\n- Exit plan: profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation if price closes below 105000 on 3-minute candle.\n- Current price is 105859.5, which is above the stop loss and above the invalidation level of 105000. So, no trigger to close. I should hold.\n\nFor DOGE:\n- Short with -100230 quantity, entry at 0.18, current 0.164595, so up (since short).\n- Exit plan: profit target 0.165215, stop loss 0.192755, invalidation if price closes above 0.195 on 3-minute candle.\n- Current price is 0.164595, which is very close to the profit target of 0.165215. In fact, current price is 0.164595, and profit target is 0.165215, so it's only about 0.00062 away, which is a small move. Since the price is near the profit target, and it might hit soon, but the signal is to hold unless invalidation triggers. The profit target should be executed automatically if hit. So, I should hold and let it run.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new trades. My available cash is 5963.12, and I should only enter if I expect a move to exceed trading costs significantly.\n\nLook at the market data:\n\n- BTC: Price is 105859.5, RSI is extremely oversold at 6.211 (7-period), which is highly unusual and suggests a potential bounce. EMA20 is above current price, MACD negative but might be bottoming. However, I'm already long BTC, so I can't enter another position in BTC. Only one position per coin.\n\n- ETH: Current price 3619.95, RSI 6.03 (7-period), also extremely oversold. EMA20 at 3694.641, above current. MACD negative. Funding rate is slightly negative. Open interest stable. This looks oversold, might be a buying opportunity. I have no position in ETH, so I could enter.\n\n- SOL: Price 166.725, RSI 3.011, extremely oversold. EMA20 at 173.851, above. MACD negative. Funding negative. Oversold, potential bounce.\n\n- BNB: Price 974.745, RSI 2.994, even more oversold. EMA20 at 1009.44, above. MACD negative. Funding negative.\n\n- XRP: I'm already long, so no new entry.\n\n- DOGE: I'm short, and price is near my profit target, so probably not a good time to enter a new position in DOGE.\n\nI should consider entering a long position in an oversold coin where I don't have a position. ETH, SOL, BNB are candidates.\n\nConfidence: Since RSI is below 10 for all, which is rare, I can have high confidence in a bounce. But I need to size appropriately.\n\nAvailable cash: 5963.12. I should use a portion based on confidence.\n\nFor ETH: RSI 6.03, which is extremely low. Historical oversold levels might indicate a strong bounce. Confidence could be high, say 0.85.\n\nSuggested margin for confidence 0.85-0.95 is 40-100% of available cash. But I need to be cautious as I already have positions, and available cash is for new trades. I should not risk too much.\n\nI have three positions, so I should not over-leverage. But the instruction is to size based on confidence for each trade independently, but I need to ensure I don't exceed available cash.\n\nAvailable cash is 5963.12. If I enter a new trade, I need margin to be at least 5% of available cash, so min margin 0.05 * 5963.12 ≈ 298.156, and max up to available cash.\n\nFor ETH, with high confidence, I could use say 50% of available cash, so margin ≈ 2981.56 (half of 5963.12). But let's calculate based on confidence table.\n\nConfidence: I'll set it at 0.85 for ETH, since RSI is 6.03, which is very oversold, and price is below EMA, potential mean reversion.\n\nMargin: for 0.85 confidence, 40-100%, so I'll choose 60% for safety, so margin = 0.6 * 5963.12 ≈ 3577.872. But I need to check if this is within available cash. Available cash is 5963.12, so yes, but I might want to leave some buffer. Since I have other positions, I should be conservative. Perhaps use 40% or 50%.\n\nRisk_usd: risk_usd = r * margin, with r between 0.2 and 0.8. I'll set r=0.5 for balanced risk, so risk_usd = 0.5 * margin.\n\nLeverage: for ETH, max leverage is 25x, min 5x. I'll use 10x for capital efficiency.\n\nThen, notional = margin * leverage.\n\nEntry price: current_price = 3619.95\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price\n\nStop distance = risk_usd / quantity\n\nFor long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance\n\nProfit target: I need to set a realistic target. Since it's oversold, I can aim for a move back to EMA20 or higher. EMA20 is 3694.641, which is about 74.69 points above, or about 2.06% increase. But with fees and risk, I need a larger move. Perhaps set profit target at 3800 or something. I should base it on ATR or something.\n\nLook at ATR: for ETH, 4-hour ATR: 3-period ATR=40.329, 14-period=35.786. So volatility is about 40 points. A bounce could be 1 ATR or more. Set profit target at entry + 1 ATR = 3619.95 + 40.33 ≈ 3660.28, but that's only 1.1% increase, which might not cover costs well. Trading costs are 0.09% round-trip, so 1.1% is above, but I need significant alpha. Perhaps 2 ATR or to EMA20.\n\nEMA20 is 3694.64, which is 74.69 points above, about 2.06%. Set profit target at 3700 or 3750.\n\nI need to make profit target a multiple of stop distance. Stop distance will be determined by risk.\n\nFirst, decide margin and risk.\n\nSimilarly for other coins.\n\nBut I should only enter one new trade if I see alpha. ETH seems promising.\n\nSOL and BNB are also oversold, but I might not have enough cash for multiple entries. The instruction is to act on coins I want to enter, but I should prioritize.\n\nI can enter multiple coins if I have cash, but each entry must be justified.\n\nBut to avoid over-trading, perhaps enter the most oversold one.\n\nBNB has RSI 2.994, even lower than ETH's 6.03. SOL is 3.011. So BNB is the most oversold.\n\nBut I need to check other factors.\n\nFunding rates: all are slightly negative or positive, but small.\n\nOpen interest: not changing much.\n\nPerhaps all are oversold, but I should choose one.\n\nSince I'm already in three positions, I might not want to add too many. But the instruction doesn't say I can't have multiple positions; it says no pyramiding on the same coin, but different coins are fine.\n\nI have positions in XRP, BTC, DOGE, so ETH, SOL, BNB are free.\n\nI could enter one or more.\n\nBut available cash is 5963.12, and if I enter a position, margin should be at least 5% of available cash, so min about 298, so I could enter small positions, but the instruction says \"don't even bother entering small positions that only use <5%\", meaning I should not enter if margin <5%, so margin must be >=5% of available cash.\n\nFor each entry, margin >= 0.05 * available_cash = 298.156.\n\nAnd margin <= available_cash.\n\nNow, for confidence, if I set confidence high, margin high.\n\nPerhaps I should enter a long in BNB or ETH.\n\nLet's calculate for BNB.\n\nBNB current price 974.745, RSI 2.994, extremely oversold.\n\nConfidence: very high, say 0.9.\n\nMargin: for 0.9 confidence, 40-100%, say 60% of available cash? 0.6 * 5963.12 ≈ 3577.872.\n\nBut if I do that, I might not have cash for others, but I can enter only one if I want.\n\nRisk_usd: r=0.5, risk_usd=0.5*3577.872≈1788.936\n\nLeverage: for BNB, max 10x, min 5x, use 10x.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 3577.872 * 10 = 35778.72 USD\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 35778.72 / 974.745 ≈ 36.70 BNB (approx)\n\nStop distance = risk_usd / quantity = 1788.936 / 36.70 ≈ 48.75\n\nSo stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 974.745 - 48.75 = 925.995\n\nProfit target: I need to set a realistic target. EMA20 is 1009.44, which is about 34.695 points above, or 3.56% increase. ATR: 4-hour ATR 3-period=15.127, 14-period=10.139, so volatility about 15 points. A bounce to EMA20 is about 2.3 ATR (34.695/15.127≈2.29), which is reasonable. Set profit target at EMA20 or slightly above, say 1010.\n\nThen profit distance = 1010 - 974.745 = 35.255\n\nStop distance is 48.75, so profit distance is less than stop distance? That's not good; I want profit target to be a multiple of stop distance for positive expectancy.\n\nProfit distance should be larger than stop distance ideally.\n\nStop distance is 48.75, profit distance 35.255, so ratio less than 1, which is bad. I need to adjust.\n\nI can set a tighter stop or higher profit target.\n\nIf I set stop loss closer, risk_usd decreases, but I need to keep risk_usd as a fraction of margin.\n\nPerhaps I need to choose a stop loss based on support or volatility.\n\nTypically, for oversold bounces, stop loss might be below recent lows.\n\nLook at BNB prices: recent low is 974.745 (current), but series shows it dropped from 1017 to 974, so support might be lower. EMA20 is 1009, so price is below EMA.\n\nI can set stop loss at a level where if broken, the downtrend continues.\n\nPerhaps use ATR for stop. For example, set stop loss at entry - 1 ATR or 2 ATR.\n\nATR is about 15, so stop distance 15 or 30.\n\nIf I set stop distance smaller, then risk_usd decreases, but for the same margin, quantity is fixed, so stop distance = risk_usd / quantity.\n\nI have margin, leverage, quantity, risk_usd related.\n\nI need to decide margin and risk_usd first.\n\nPerhaps for oversold bounce, I can have a tighter stop, as the bounce should happen quickly if it does.\n\nSet risk_usd smaller r, say r=0.3.\n\nLet's try for BNB.\n\nConfidence 0.9, margin = 0.6 * 5963.12 = 3577.872\n\nr=0.3, risk_usd = 0.3 * 3577.872 = 1073.3616\n\nLeverage=10x\n\nNotional=35778.72\n\nQuantity=35778.72 / 974.745 ≈ 36.70\n\nStop distance = risk_usd / quantity = 1073.3616 / 36.70 ≈ 29.25\n\nStop_loss = 974.745 - 29.25 = 945.495\n\nProfit target: set at EMA20 1009.44, distance 34.695, which is greater than stop distance 29.25, so ratio about 1.19, which is better but still low. I want multiple, say 2 or 3.\n\nPerhaps set profit target higher, say 1020 or to next resistance.\n\n4-hour EMA50 is 1092.638, too far. Perhaps 1010 is fine, but ratio is low.\n\nI can increase leverage to make notional larger, but quantity increases, stop distance decreases for same risk_usd.\n\nStop distance = risk_usd / quantity\n\nQuantity = notional / price = (margin * leverage) / price\n\nSo stop distance = risk_usd / [ (margin * leverage) / price ] = (risk_usd * price) / (margin * leverage)\n\nBut risk_usd = r * margin, so stop distance = (r * margin * price) / (margin * leverage) = (r * price) / leverage\n\nOh! So stop distance is independent of margin? Let's see.\n\nstop_distance = risk_usd / quantity\n\nrisk_usd = r * margin\n\nquantity = notional / price = (margin * leverage) / price\n\nso stop_distance = (r * margin) / [ (margin * leverage) / price ] = (r * margin) * (price / (margin * leverage)) = (r * price) / leverage\n\nYes, so stop distance = (r * price) / leverage\n\nSimilarly, for long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = price - (r * price) / leverage = price * (1 - r/leverage)\n\nProfit target distance is set by me.\n\nSo for a given leverage and r, stop distance is fixed relative to price.\n\nI need to choose leverage and r such that stop distance is reasonable.\n\nFor example, for BNB, price=974.745, if leverage=10, r=0.5, stop_distance = (0.5 * 974.745) / 10 = 487.3725 / 10 = 48.73725, as before.\n\nIf I want smaller stop distance, I can increase leverage or decrease r.\n\nMax leverage for BNB is 10x, so I can't increase beyond 10. Min leverage is 5x.\n\nIf I use leverage=10, r=0.2, stop_distance = (0.2 * 974.745) / 10 = 194.949 / 10 = 19.4949\n\nThen stop_loss = 974.745 - 19.495 = 955.25\n\nProfit target: if set to 1010, distance 35.255, ratio about 1.81, which is better.\n\nr=0.2 is allowed, since r between 0.2 and 0.8.\n\nSimilarly, for profit target, I can set it to capture a move.\n\nNow, invalidation condition: something rare, like if price breaks below a key level. For example, if price closes below 950 on 3-minute candle or something.\n\nSimilarly for other coins.\n\nBut I need to decide which coin to enter.\n\nPerhaps ETH is better because it's larger cap, more liquid.\n\nETH price 3619.95, leverage max 25x.\n\nIf I use leverage=25, r=0.2, stop_distance = (0.2 * 3619.95) / 25 = 723.99 / 25 = 28.9596\n\nStop_loss = 3619.95 - 28.96 = 3590.99\n\nProfit target: EMA20 is 3694.64, distance 74.69, ratio to stop distance 74.69 / 28.96 ≈ 2.58, which is good.\n\nATR is about 40, so 74.69 is about 1.87 ATR, reasonable.\n\nConfidence for ETH: RSI 6.03, high confidence, say 0.85.\n\nMargin: for 0.85 confidence, 40-100%, say 50% of available cash? 0.5 * 5963.12 = 2981.56\n\nThen risk_usd = r * margin = 0.2 * 2981.56 = 596.312\n\nLeverage=25x\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 2981.56 * 25 = 74539 USD\n\nQuantity = notional / price = 74539 / 3619.95 ≈ 20.59 ETH\n\nStop distance as above, 28.96, stop_loss=3590.99\n\nProfit target: set at 3700, for example, distance 80.05, ratio about 2.76.\n\nOr to EMA20 3694.64, but 3700 is fine.\n\nInvalidation: if price closes below 3580 or something.\n\nBut I need to check if I have enough cash. Available cash is 5963.12, margin 2981.56 is less, so ok.\n\nI could enter ETH.\n\nSimilarly for SOL.\n\nSOL price 166.725, leverage max 20x.\n\nRSI 3.011, very oversold.\n\nConfidence 0.9.\n\nMargin: say 50% of available cash? 2981.56\n\nr=0.2, leverage=20x\n\nstop_distance = (0.2 * 166.725) / 20 = 33.345 / 20 = 1.66725\n\nstop_loss = 166.725 - 1.667 = 165.058\n\nProfit target: EMA20 is 173.851, distance 7.126, ratio 7.126 / 1.667 ≈ 4.27, very good.\n\nBut the absolute distance is small, 7 points, while ATR is about 2.783, so 7/2.783≈2.5 ATR, possible.\n\nBut SOL might be volatile.\n\nETH might be safer.\n\nI should enter one coin.\n\nAlso, I have existing positions, so I need to manage them.\n\nFor existing positions, I need to output hold or close.\n\nFor XRP: current price 2.33765, stop loss is 2.325, and current is above, so hold. Invalidation is below 2.30, not hit.\n\nFor BTC: current 105859.5, stop loss 102026.675, above, invalidation below 105000, current above, so hold.\n\nFor DOGE: short, current 0.164595, profit target 0.165215, very close, but since it's not hit, I should hold. Invalidation above 0.195, not hit.\n\nSo for all existing, hold.\n\nNow, for new entry, I think ETH is a good candidate.\n\nI'll enter a long on ETH.\n\nConfidence: 0.85\n\nMargin: I'll use 50% of available cash, so margin = 0.5 * 5963.12 = 2981.56\n\nLeverage: 25x (max for ETH)\n\nrisk_usd: set r=0.2, so risk_usd = 0.2 * 2981.56 = 596.312\n\nThen notional = margin * leverage = 2981.56 * 25 = 74539\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 74539 / 3619.95 ≈ 20.59 (I need to calculate exactly)\n\nActually, quantity should be calculated precisely.\n\nentry_price = 3619.95\n\nnotional = 74539\n\nquantity = 74539 / 3619.95 ≈ 20.592 (let's compute: 3619.95 * 20.592 ≈ ? 3600*20.592=74131.2, 19.95*20.592≈410.5, total 74541.7, close enough, but I should use exact.\n\nIn code, it would be precise, but for JSON, I can use float.\n\nStop distance = risk_usd / quantity = 596.312 / 20.592 ≈ 28.96 (as before)\n\nStop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 3619.95 - 28.96 = 3590.99\n\nProfit target: I'll set it to 3700, which is about 2.21% above, and stop loss is about 0.8% below, so ratio about 2.76.\n\nInvalidation condition: \"If the price closes below 3580 on a 3-minute candle\" or something. But I should make it quantifiable. Since stop loss is 3590.99, invalidation should be something else, like if a larger pattern breaks. Perhaps \"If the 20-period EMA on 4-hour turns down\" but that might be too slow. Or \"If the price breaks below the recent low of 3619.95\" but that's entry. Recent low in the series: the prices are decreasing, so current is low. Perhaps \"If the price closes below 3600 on a 3-minute candle\" but that's close to stop loss. I need something rarer.\n\nInvalidation should be a condition that invalidates the thesis, not just a stop loss. For example, if the oversold condition resolves without bounce, but that's vague.\n\nPerhaps \"If the RSI(7) rises above 20 without the price increasing significantly\" but that's complicated.\n\nA simple one: \"If the price closes below 3550 on a 3-minute candle\" which is below the stop loss, so it might not hit before stop loss.\n\nBut stop loss is at 3590, so if price goes below 3590, stop loss hits. Invalidation should be for early exit if the reason for entry is invalid, but since the reason is oversold, if price continues down, stop loss will hit.\n\nI can set invalidation to \"None\" or something, but the instruction says \"invalidation_condition: a measurable quantity that acts as the only reason to exit a position, outside of the stop being hit. must be specific & quantifiable; rare.\"\n\nSo it's for exiting before stop loss if the alpha is gone.\n\nFor example, if the RSI quickly rises above 30 without price increase, indicating weak bounce, but that might be too subjective.\n\nPerhaps \"If the MACD histogram turns positive but price fails to rise above 3650\" but complicated.\n\nI'll keep it simple: \"If the price closes below 3580 on a 3-minute candle\" but that's very close to stop loss at 3590. Difference of 10 points, which is small.\n\nPerhaps set invalidation at a key level. Since EMA20 is 3694, and price is below, if price breaks above EMA20, that might confirm bounce, but for invalidation, it should be for downside.\n\nPerhaps \"If the 20-period EMA on the 3-minute chart turns down\" but EMAs are slow.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll set invalidation to \"If the price closes below 3570 on a 3-minute candle\" which is below stop loss, so it might not be hit, but it's rare.\n\nAnother idea: \"If the funding rate becomes strongly positive\" but it's negative now.\n\nI'll set it to a price level below.\n\nSimilarly for other coins.\n\nNow, for ETH entry.\n\nJustification: \"ETH is extremely oversold with RSI(7) at 6.03, indicating a high probability of a bounce. Price is below EMA20, suggesting mean reversion potential. I expect a move to 3700 to capture the rebound.\"\n\nConfidence: 0.85\n\nNow, for the JSON output.\n\nI need to output for each coin I act on: for ETH, it's entry, so use the entry format.\n\nFor existing positions, use hold format.\n\nSo coins: XRP, BTC, DOGE (hold), and ETH (buy_to_enter).\n\nI need to specify quantity, etc., for hold, I need to provide the current size and the exit plan details from the position.\n\nIn the hold JSON, I need to include profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd from the existing position.\n\nSimilarly for close, but I'm holding.\n\nSo for each existing position, I output a JSON with signal 'hold', and the quantities from the position.\n\nIn the input, for each position, I have exit_plan with profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and also confidence, risk_usd, leverage.\n\nSo I should use those values in the hold signal.\n\nSimilarly, for entry, I set new values.\n\nSo for XRP hold:\n\nsignal: 'hold'\n\nquantity: 3609.0 (from position)\n\nprofit_target: 2.815 (from exit_plan)\n\nstop_loss: 2.325 (from exit_plan)\n\ninvalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\" (from exit_plan)\n\nleverage: 10 (from position)\n\nconfidence: 0.65 (from position)\n\nrisk_usd: 442.032 (from position)\n\nSimilarly for BTC and DOGE.\n\nFor DOGE, since it's short, but in the JSON, quantity is positive for both long and short, I think? In the entry example, for sell_to_enter, quantity is positive, and direction is handled by signal.\n\nIn the position, for DOGE, quantity is -100230, but in the JSON, for hold or close, quantity should be the absolute size? Let's check the instruction.\n\nIn the close example: \"quantity\": <full current size>\n\nIn the position, for DOGE, quantity is -100230, which is negative indicating short.\n\nBut in the JSON, for signal, if it's sell_to_enter, quantity is positive, and the sign is implied by signal.\n\nSimilarly, for hold and close, quantity should be the absolute value? Or the signed value?\n\nLook at the examples: for close_position, quantity is <full current size>, and in the position, it's given as negative for short.\n\nIn the input, for DOGE, 'quantity': -100230, so current size is -100230.\n\nIn the JSON output, for close_position or hold, I think I should use the signed quantity, because downstream might need to know the direction.\n\nBut in the example JSON, for entry, quantity is positive, and signal indicates direction.\n\nFor hold and close, since the position already has a direction, I should provide the signed quantity.\n\nIn the close example, it says \"quantity\": <full current size>, and in the position, it's signed, so I'll use the signed quantity.\n\nSimilarly for hold.\n\nSo for DOGE, quantity: -100230.\n\nNow, for the new ETH entry.\n\nSignal: 'buy_to_enter'\n\nquantity: calculated, 74539 / 3619.95 = let's compute exactly.\n\nentry_price = 3619.95\n\nnotional = margin * leverage = 2981.56 * 25 = 74539\n\nquantity = notional / entry_price = 74539 / 3619.95 ≈ 20.592\n\nI need to calculate precisely.\n\n74539 ÷ 3619.95 = ? Let's do division: 3619.95 * 20 = 72399, remainder 74539 - 72399 = 2140, so 20 + 2140 / 3619.95 ≈ 20 + 0.591, so 20.591, so approximately 20.591\n\nI'll use 20.59 or 20.591, but in JSON, float is fine.\n\nSimilarly, stop_loss = 3619.95 - (risk_usd / quantity)\n\nrisk_usd = 596.312\n\nquantity = 74539 / 3619.95\n\nFirst, compute quantity exactly: 74539 / 3619.95 = 7453900 / 361995 ≈ let's calculate.\n\n3619.95 = 361995/100, so quantity = 74539 / (361995/100) = 74539 * 100 / 361995 = 7453900 / 361995\n\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 5: 1490780 / 72399\n\nNow, 72399 * 20 = 1447980, remainder 1490780 - 1447980 = 42800, so 20 + 42800 / 72399 ≈ 20 + 0.591, so 20.591\n\nSo quantity ≈ 20.591\n\nThen stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 596.312 / 20.591 ≈ 28.96\n\nStop_loss = 3619.95 - 28.96 = 3590.99\n\nProfit_target = 3700\n\nInvalidation_condition: I'll set \"If the price closes below 3570 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nLeverage: 25\n\nConfidence: 0.85\n\nRisk_usd: 596.312\n\nJustification for ETH: \"ETH is severely oversold with RSI(7) at 6.03, suggesting a high likelihood of a bounce. Price is below EMA20, and I anticipate a mean reversion to 3700. The risk-reward ratio is favorable with a stop at 3590.99.\"\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to output one JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo coins: XRP, BTC, DOGE, ETH.\n\nFor XRP, BTC, DOGE, signal 'hold', with their existing values.\n\nFor ETH, signal 'buy_to_enter' with new values.\n\nI need to make sure the quantities are correct.\n\nAlso, for hold, I don't need to change anything, just report the current state.\n\nSo let's compile the JSON.\n\nFirst, for XRP:\n\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 3609.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.815,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.325,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 442.032\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSimilarly for BTC:\n\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.12,\n      \"profit_target\": 118136.15,\n      \"stop_loss\": 102026.675,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 619.2345\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nFor DOGE:\n\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": -100230.0,  // negative for short\n      \"profit_target\": 0.165215,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.192755,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 920.034\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nFor ETH:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"justification\": \"ETH is extremely oversold with RSI(7) at 6.03, indicating a high probability of a bounce.

Let's check.\n\nIn the hold example:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification field for hold or close, only for entry.\n\nIn close, there is justification, but for hold, no.\n\nIn the close example:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"justification\": \"<1–2 sentences>\",\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nFor close, there is justification, for hold, no justification.\n\nIn the instruction: for hold, the JSON example does not have justification, but for close and entry, it does.\n\nSo for hold, I should not include justification.\n\nSimilarly, for entry and close, I should include justification.\n\nIn my case, for hold positions, no justification.\n\nFor ETH entry, include justification.\n\nNow, I think that's all.\n\nI am considering if I should enter other coins, but I think one entry is enough for now, to avoid over-trading.\n\nAlso, available cash after ETH entry: margin 2981.56 is used, so remaining cash = 5963.12 - 2981.56 = 2981.56, which is still above 5% of original available cash? 5% of 5963.12 is 298.156, so I could enter another small position, but perhaps not now.\n\nI'll stick with ETH.\n\nSo final output.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "My DOGE short is nearing profit, but I'm holding all existing positions as they haven't triggered their stop-losses or invalidation conditions.

Stop loss is at 0.192755, which is above. Invalidation is above 0.195, not triggered. I should hold.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new trades. I have available cash of 2989.45. But I already have four positions, and I should avoid over-trading. Also, the instructions say: \"No pyramiding or size increases.\" So I shouldn't add to existing positions.\n\nI should look for new opportunities in coins I'm not in, which are SOL and BNB.\n\nFirst, SOL:\n- Current price: 169.205\n- EMA20: 173.001, price below EMA\n- MACD: -1.694, negative\n- RSI (7): 29.964, oversold\n- Funding rate: -0.0001503544, negative\n- Open interest: latest 4953752.56, average 5105038.87, slightly decreased\n- Longer-term: EMA20 184.32 vs EMA50 188.269, bearish crossover? MACD negative, RSI 31.434 low\n- Volume: current 959.97 vs average 679164.048, very low volume, which might indicate lack of interest or potential reversal.\n\nRSI is oversold, price below EMA, but MACD negative. Funding negative, which might favor shorts, but RSI oversold could mean bounce. However, with low volume, it might not be a strong signal. Confidence might be low.\n\nBNB:\n- Current price: 992.085\n- EMA20: 1007.899, price below EMA\n- MACD: -6.704, negative\n- RSI (7): 37.575, neutral to oversold\n- Funding rate: -5.73601e-05, negative\n- Open interest: latest 60438.7, average 62450.25, decreased\n- Longer-term: EMA20 1073.997 vs EMA50 1092.638, bearish, MACD negative, RSI 25.105 oversold\n- Volume: current 1.131 vs average 8553.690, extremely low volume.\n\nSimilar to SOL, oversold conditions, but weak momentum and low volume.\n\nI don't see a strong alpha signal for either SOL or BNB. RSI is oversold, but without confirmation, it might not be worth entering. Also, funding is negative for both, which might pressure prices down, but RSI oversold could lead to bounce. However, my confidence would be low, probably below 0.6, so margin would be less than 10% of available cash, which is 2989.45 * 0.1 = 298.945, and since minimum margin is 5% of available cash, which is 2989.45 * 0.05 = 149.4725, so if confidence is low, I might skip if margin < 5%, but 5% is about 149.47, which is small, but for entry, I need to ensure risk_usd is fraction of margin.\n\nBut given the weak signals, I think it's better not to enter new trades. I should focus on managing existing positions.\n\nFor existing positions, I need to output JSON for each coin with 'hold' signal, since no invalidation conditions are met.\n\nFor each hold, I need to provide the same details: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd. These are already provided in the account information, so I can use those values.\n\nSimilarly, for close, if I were to close, but I'm not.\n\nSo, for ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, I should output hold.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to have one JSON object per coin, with the trade_signal_args.\n\nLet me structure it.\n\nFirst, ETH:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 20.55,\n      \"profit_target\": 3700.0,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3590.99,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 3570 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 0.85,\n      \"risk_usd\": 596.312\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI don't need to change anything; just hold.\n\nAlso, for justification, since it's hold, I don't need to provide justification in the JSON for hold signals. Looking back at the instructions, for hold, the JSON doesn't include \"justification\" key. Only for entry and close, there is justification.\n\nIn the hold example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n\t  \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n\t  \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNo justification mentioned. Similarly for close, justification is required, but for hold, it's not.\n\nIn the entry and close examples, justification is part of trade_signal_args, but for hold, it's not included in the example. So I should omit justification for hold.\n\nNow, for XRP, BTC, DOGE.\n\nXRP:\n\nquantity: 3609.0, profit_target: 2.815, stop_loss: 2.325, invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage: 10, confidence: 0.65, risk_usd: 442.032\n\nBTC:\n\nquantity: 0.12, profit_target: 118136.15, stop_loss: 102026.675, invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage: 10, confidence: 0.75, risk_usd: 619.2345\n\nDOGE:\n\nquantity: -100230.0, but in the JSON, quantity should be the absolute size, I think. Looking at the account info, it's negative for short, but in the JSON output, for hold, it should be the full current size, which is the absolute quantity, but with signal hold, the direction is implied by the position.\n\nIn the hold example, quantity is <full current size>, which from account, for DOGE, it's -100230.0, but in JSON, I think we need to output the quantity as is, including sign for short positions? No, in the entry, quantity is positive for both buy and sell, but direction is handled by signal.\n\nIn the entry JSON, for sell_to_enter, quantity is positive, and signal indicates direction.\n\nSimilarly, for hold, since the position is already there, quantity should include the sign to indicate long or short.\n\nIn the account info, DOGE has quantity -100230.0, which is short.\n\nIn the JSON output for hold, I should include the quantity with sign.\n\nSimilarly, for profit_target and stop_loss, they are set accordingly.\n\nFor DOGE, since it's short, profit_target is lower, stop_loss is higher.\n\nIn the JSON, I need to output the same values.\n\nSo for DOGE:\n\nquantity: -100230.0, profit_target: 0.165215, stop_loss: 0.192755, invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage: 10, confidence: 0.7, risk_usd: 920.034\n\nNow, I think that's all.\n\nI am not entering any new trades, so only output for existing positions.\n\nFinally, the JSON should be an object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, overall output should be a JSON object with \"ETH\", \"XRP\", \"BTC\", \"DOGE\" keys.\n\nIn the response, I need to output only JSON, no prose.\n\nSo, let me compile the JSON.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "My ETH, BTC, and DOGE positions are performing well, with ETH up and DOGE showing a healthy profit from my short, while BTC is holding steady despite being slightly down. I'm sticking with my current holdings as no invalidation conditions have been met, focusing on maximizing gains from my profitable trades and waiting for market shifts."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in XRP, BTC, and DOGE.\n\nFor XRP: I'm long with quantity 3609, entry price 2.44, current price 2.34875. The exit plan has profit target at 2.815 and stop loss at 2.325. The invalidation condition is if price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is 2.34875, which is above 2.30, so invalidation hasn't triggered. Stop loss is at 2.325, and current price is above that, so I should hold unless invalidation hits.\n\nFor BTC: I'm long with quantity 0.12, entry price 107343.0, current price 105840.5. Exit plan has profit target at 118136.15 and stop loss at 102026.675. Invalidation condition is if price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is 105840.5, which is above 105000, so no invalidation. Stop loss is at 102026.675, current price is above, so hold.\n\nFor DOGE: I'm short with quantity -100230, entry price 0.18, current price 0.167685. Profit target is 0.165215 and stop loss is 0.192755. Invalidation condition is if price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is 0.167685, well below 0.195, so no invalidation. Stop loss is at 0.192755, current price is below, so hold.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new trades. I have available cash of 5377.89. But I should only enter if I see a significant opportunity that exceeds trading costs.\n\nLooking at the market data:\n\n- BTC: Price is down, RSI is very low at 22.819, which is oversold. MACD is negative but might be bottoming. However, I already have a long position, and adding another might not be wise due to no pyramiding rule. I should stick to my existing position.\n\n- ETH: Current price 3588.25, EMA20 at 3673.517, so below EMA. RSI is extremely low at 9.348, which is deeply oversold. MACD is negative. Funding rate is negative, which might indicate bearish sentiment, but oversold conditions could mean a bounce. However, I don't have a position, and this might be an opportunity. But I need to be confident.\n\n- SOL: Similar story, price down, RSI low at 24.617, oversold. Funding negative.\n\n- BNB: Price down, RSI 31.569, not as oversold as others.\n\n- XRP: I already have a position, and it's losing, but exit plan is still valid.\n\n- DOGE: I'm short and it's profitable, so hold.\n\nFor new entries, I should consider coins where RSI is very low, indicating potential reversal. ETH has RSI at 9.348, which is extremely oversold. That might be a good buy opportunity.\n\nBut I need to size it correctly. Confidence: since RSI is below 10, which is rare, I should have high confidence. Suggested range for 0.85-0.95 confidence is 40-100% of available cash. But I should be cautious because the market is bearish.\n\nAvailable cash is 5377.89. Minimum margin should be at least 5% of available cash, which is about 268.89. For ETH, let's say I'm confident at 0.85.\n\nI need to decide margin, leverage, risk_usd, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation.\n\nFirst, margin: with confidence 0.85, I could use say 50% of available cash, so margin = 0.5 * 5377.89 = 2688.945 USD.\n\nLeverage for ETH max is 25x, but I should use at least 5x. Since I'm confident, I might use high leverage, but need to avoid liquidation.\n\nRisk_usd: should be a fraction of margin, say r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 2688.945 = 1344.4725 USD.\n\nNow, entry price for ETH is 3588.25.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage. I need to choose leverage. Let's use 10x for now, so notional = 2688.945 * 10 = 26889.45 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 26889.45 / 3588.25 ≈ 7.497 ETH. But since it's perps, quantity should be in units, so about 7.5 ETH.\n\nStop_distance for long: risk_usd / quantity = 1344.4725 / 7.497 ≈ 179.36 USD per ETH? No, stop_distance is in price terms.\n\nrisk_usd is the amount I lose if stop hit. For long, if price drops by stop_distance, loss is quantity * stop_distance.\n\nSo stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity.\n\nBut quantity = notional / entry_price = (margin * leverage) / entry_price\n\nSo stop_distance = risk_usd / ( (margin * leverage) / entry_price ) = (risk_usd * entry_price) / (margin * leverage)\n\nFrom earlier: risk_usd = r * margin\n\nSo stop_distance = (r * margin * entry_price) / (margin * leverage) = (r * entry_price) / leverage\n\nThat simplifies things.\n\nFor long: stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = entry_price - (r * entry_price) / leverage = entry_price * (1 - r / leverage)\n\nSimilarly, profit_target should be a multiple of stop_distance.\n\nI need to set profit_target realistically.\n\nFirst, for ETH, let's calculate stop_distance.\n\nAssume r=0.5, leverage=10, entry_price=3588.25\n\nstop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage = (0.5 * 3588.25) / 10 = 1794.125 / 10 = 179.4125? No:\n\n(r * entry_price) / leverage = 0.5 * 3588.25 / 10 = 1794.125 / 10 = 179.4125? That can't be right because entry price is 3588, so stop distance should be smaller.\n\nMistake: stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity\n\nquantity = notional / entry_price = (margin * leverage) / entry_price\n\nrisk_usd = r * margin\n\nSo stop_distance = (r * margin) / ( (margin * leverage) / entry_price ) = (r * margin) * (entry_price / (margin * leverage)) = (r * entry_price) / leverage\n\nYes, so for leverage=10, r=0.5, entry_price=3588.25, stop_distance = (0.5 * 3588.25) / 10 = 1794.125 / 10 = 179.4125? 1794.125 / 10 = 179.4125, but that seems large because entry price is 3588, so a drop of 179 is about 5%, which might be reasonable.\n\nstop_distance = 179.4125\n\nSo stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 3588.25 - 179.4125 = 3408.8375\n\nNow, profit_target should be a multiple, say 2x or 3x stop_distance. But I need to consider where resistance might be.\n\nLooking at EMA20 for ETH is 3673.517, which is above current price, so if it bounces, it might target EMA or higher.\n\n4-hour EMA20 is 3839.571, so perhaps set profit_target around there.\n\nBut profit distance should be multiple of stop_distance. stop_distance is 179.4125, so for 2x, profit distance = 358.825, so profit_target = entry_price + 358.825 = 3947.075, which is above EMA20 and 50-period EMA.\n\n50-period EMA is 3894.793, so 3947 is above that, might be ambitious.\n\nFor 3x, profit distance = 538.2375, profit_target=4126.4875, still high.\n\nI could set it based on RSI rebound or something.\n\nSince RSI is very low, a bounce to mean could be likely.\n\nCurrent price 3588, EMA20 3673, difference 85, so not huge. But from oversold, it might overshoot.\n\nI should set profit_target to a reasonable level, say 3800 or something.\n\nBut let's calculate based on multiple.\n\nI need to justify the trade.\n\nInvalidation condition: for a long, if price breaks below a key level, say if it closes below 3400 or something, but my stop_loss is already at 3408, so invalidation might be redundant or set differently.\n\nIn the exit plan, invalidation is for early exit, so I might set it if RSI goes lower or something.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed.\n\nConfidence: I think with RSI at 9.348, it's very oversold, so confidence high, say 0.9.\n\nMargin: with confidence 0.9, I can use high margin, say 80% of available cash? But available cash is 5377.89, 80% is 4302.312, but I have other positions, and I should not over-leverage.\n\nThe available cash is after considering existing positions, so it's free cash.\n\nBut if I use too much, I might risk too much.\n\nRisk_usd should be less than margin.\n\nFor ETH, let's decide.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin I act on or hold.\n\nFor existing positions, I need to output hold signals with their current details.\n\nFor XRP, BTC, DOGE, I should hold since no invalidation.\n\nFor ETH, I might enter a long.\n\nBut let's check if there are other opportunities.\n\nSOL has RSI 24.617, which is oversold but not as much as ETH.\n\nETH RSI is 9.348, which is extremely low, so probably best opportunity.\n\nBNB RSI 31.569, not very low.\n\nXRP I already have.\n\nDOGE I'm short.\n\nBTC I have long.\n\nSo perhaps only ETH for new entry.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the expected move exceeds trading costs.\n\nTrading costs: round-trip 0.09%, plus funding. Funding for ETH is negative, which means if I'm long, I pay funding, so it's a cost.\n\nFunding rate is -3.19026e-05, which is negative, so for long position, I would pay funding, which is a small cost but adds up.\n\nExpected move: if RSI rebounds, price could go back to EMA20 at 3673 or higher, which is about 85 points up from 3588, about 2.37% increase.\n\nStop distance is about 179 points, which is 5% down.\n\nSo risk-reward: upside 85, downside 179, so not great if I set profit target at EMA.\n\nBut if I set profit target higher, say to 3800, that's 212 points up, which is better.\n\n212 / 179 ≈ 1.18, so risk-reward about 1:1.18, which is not great, but with high confidence, might be ok.\n\nSince RSI is so low, the bounce could be sharp, so perhaps it can go higher.\n\n4-hour RSI is 33.123, which is not extremely low, but intraday is low.\n\nI need to consider the longer-term context.\n\nMACD on 4-hour is negative but might be improving.\n\nCurrent MACD intraday is -26.842, previous was -22.392, so worsening, but RSI low might indicate reversal soon.\n\nPerhaps I should wait for confirmation, but as a systematic trader, I might take the oversold signal.\n\nBut let's see the account: I already have three positions, and adding another might increase risk.\n\nAvailable cash is 5377, and if I use say 50% for ETH, margin 2688, leverage 10, notional 26889, which is large, but account value is 10875, so notional is about 2.47x account value, which is ok since leverage is 10, but with multiple positions, total exposure might be high.\n\nCurrent positions: XRP notional 8476, BTC notional 12700, DOGE notional 16807, total notional about 8476 + 12700 = 21176, +16807 = 37983 USD, and account value 10875, so leverage is about 37983 / 10875 ≈ 3.49, which is manageable.\n\nIf I add ETH notional 26889, total notional 37983 + 26889 = 64872, account value 10875, leverage 64872 / 10875 ≈ 5.96, which is high but possible since max leverage for ETH is 25x, but account leverage is different.\n\nThe leverage per position is set, so for ETH, if I use 10x, it's fine, but overall account might be over-leveraged if prices move against me.\n\nBut since I have stops, it should be ok.\n\nPerhaps I should be cautious and use lower margin for ETH.\n\nConfidence: RSI 9.348 is very low, so confidence high, say 0.85.\n\nMargin: 40% of available cash, so 0.4 * 5377.89 = 2151.156 USD.\n\nLeverage: use 10x for ETH.\n\nRisk_usd: r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 2151.156 = 1075.578 USD.\n\nEntry price: 3588.25\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 2151.156 * 10 = 21511.56 USD\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 21511.56 / 3588.25 ≈ 5.996 ETH, so about 6 ETH.\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 1075.578 / 6 ≈ 179.263 USD per ETH? No, stop_distance in price terms.\n\nFrom formula: stop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage = (0.5 * 3588.25) / 10 = 1794.125 / 10 = 179.4125\n\nSame as before.\n\nstop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 3588.25 - 179.4125 = 3408.8375\n\nProfit_target: I need to set it. Say I want a 2:1 reward to risk, so profit distance = 2 * stop_distance = 2 * 179.4125 = 358.825\n\nSo profit_target = entry_price + profit_distance = 3588.25 + 358.825 = 3947.075\n\nWhich is above the 4-hour EMA20 of 3839.571 and EMA50 of 3894.793, so possible but might be optimistic.\n\nAlternatively, set based on RSI or something.\n\nSince RSI is oversold, a move to 50 RSI might imply price around EMA.\n\nBut let's keep it at 3947 for now.\n\nInvalidation condition: if price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle, but my stop is at 3408, so almost same, or I can set it to if RSI remains below 10 for another period or something.\n\nTo be specific, I'll set invalidation to if the price closes below 3400, but since stop is at 3408, it might hit stop first.\n\nPerhaps set invalidation to if the MACD continues to worsen or something.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll set invalidation to \"If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle\" which is below stop, so it might not trigger often.\n\nNow, for the existing positions, I need to output hold signals.\n\nFor XRP: current quantity 3609, profit_target 2.815, stop_loss 2.325, invalidation_condition as per exit plan, leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 442.032\n\nSimilarly for BTC and DOGE.\n\nI should not change the exit plans for existing positions; just hold them.\n\nSo for output, I need JSON for each coin I have a position in, and for ETH if I enter.\n\nBut the output should be a JSON object for each coin, so for XRP, BTC, DOGE, and ETH.\n\nFirst, for hold signals:\n\nXRP:\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 3609.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.815,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.325,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 442.032\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSimilarly for BTC:\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.12,\n      \"profit_target\": 118136.15,\n      \"stop_loss\": 102026.675,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 619.2345\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nFor DOGE:\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": -100230.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.165215,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.192755,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 920.034\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNow for ETH entry:\nSignal: buy_to_enter\nJustification: ETH is extremely oversold with RSI at 9.348, indicating a high probability of bounce. Funding is slightly negative but expected move should cover costs.\nMargin: I decided 40% of available cash, so margin = 0.4 * 5377.89 = 2151.156 (but I don't need to output margin)\nLeverage: 10x\nRisk_usd: 0.5 * margin = 0.5 * 2151.156 = 1075.578\nEntry price: 3588.25\nQuantity: notional / entry_price = (2151.156 * 10) / 3588.25 = 21511.56 / 3588.25 ≈ 5.996, so let's calculate exactly.\n\nquantity = notional / entry_price = (margin * leverage) / entry_price = (2151.156 * 10) / 3588.25 = 21511.56 / 3588.25\n\nCalculate: 3588.25 * 6 = 21529.5, which is slightly more than 21511.56, so quantity = 21511.56 / 3588.25 ≈ 5.997, so approximately 5.997 ETH. But since it's quantity, I need to use a float.\n\nIn output, quantity should be the number, so let's compute it.\n\nmargin = 2151.156 (assumed, but I need to use exact for calculation.\n\nAvailable cash is 5377.89, 40% is 2151.156, but perhaps use precise.\n\n5377.89 * 0.4 = 2151.156\n\nleverage = 10\n\nnotional = 2151.156 * 10 = 21511.56\n\nentry_price = 3588.25\n\nquantity = 21511.56 / 3588.25 = let's calculate: 3588.25 * 6 = 21529.5, difference 21529.5 - 21511.56 = 17.94, so less than 6, so quantity = 21511.56 / 3588.25 ≈ 5.997\n\nExactly: 21511.56 / 3588.25 = 5.997 (approximately)\n\nBut for JSON, I can use a float.\n\nstop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage = (0.5 * 3588.25) / 10 = 1794.125 / 10 = 179.4125\n\nstop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 3588.25 - 179.4125 = 3408.8375\n\nprofit_target: I set to entry_price + 2 * stop_distance = 3588.25 + 2*179.4125 = 3588.25 + 358.825 = 3947.075\n\ninvalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nconfidence: 0.85\n\nrisk_usd: 1075.578\n\nJustification: \"ETH RSI is at 9.348, deeply oversold, suggesting a strong bounce potential. Expected move to profit target exceeds trading costs significantly.\"\n\nNow, for the output, I need to include ETH.\n\nBut I must ensure that for each coin, I output the JSON.\n\nAlso, for coins I don't act on, I don't need to output anything, only for those I have positions or enter new.\n\nSo in this case, XRP, BTC, DOGE for hold, and ETH for buy_to_enter.\n\nNow, for the JSON structure, it should be a single JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo the output should be like:\n\n{\n  \"XRP\": { ... },\n  \"BTC\": { ... },\n  \"DOGE\": { ... },\n  \"ETH\": { ... }\n}\n\nBut for ETH, it's a new entry, so signal is buy_to_enter.\n\nI need to make sure the quantities are correct.\n\nFor existing positions, quantity is the full current size, which is given.\n\nFor ETH, quantity is computed.\n\nAlso, for leverage, in hold signals, I use the existing leverage, which is 10 for all.\n\nSimilarly for risk_usd, use the existing from account.\n\nIn the account, for each position, risk_usd is provided, so I should use that for hold signals.\n\nFor new entry, I compute risk_usd.\n\nNow, finally, I need to output only JSON, no prose.\n\nSo let's compose the JSON.",

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. From the account information:\n\n1. ETH: Long position, quantity 5.98, entry price 3595.2, current price 3591.35. Unrealized PNL is negative. Exit plan: profit target 3947.075, stop loss 3408.8375, invalidation condition: price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle. Confidence 0.85.\n\n   - Current price is above stop loss and above invalidation level. RSI is extremely low at 10.325, which is oversold. EMA20 is above current price, but MACD is negative. Funding is negative, which might help longs. I should hold unless invalidation triggers.\n\n2. XRP: Long position, quantity 3609.0, entry price 2.44, current price 2.33385. Unrealized PNL negative. Exit plan: profit target 2.815, stop loss 2.325, invalidation: price closes below 2.30 on 3-minute candle.\n\n   - Current price is 2.33385, which is above stop loss (2.325) and above invalidation (2.30). RSI is 27.561, still oversold. EMA20 is 2.383, current price below EMA. MACD negative. Funding negative. Should hold unless invalidation.\n\n3. BTC: Long position, quantity 0.12, entry price 107343.0, current price 105806.5. Unrealized PNL negative. Exit plan: profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation: price closes below 105000 on 3-minute candle.\n\n   - Current price is 105806.5, which is above stop loss (102026.675) and above invalidation (105000). RSI is 22.016, very oversold. EMA20 is above current price. MACD negative. Funding positive but small. Should hold.\n\n4. DOGE: Short position, quantity -100230.0, entry price 0.18, current price 0.166865. Unrealized PNL positive. Exit plan: profit target 0.165215, stop loss 0.192755, invalidation: price closes above 0.195 on 3-minute candle.\n\n   - Current price is 0.166865, which is below stop loss (0.192755) and below invalidation (0.195). RSI is 31.35, not extremely oversold. EMA20 is 0.171, current price below EMA. MACD negative. Funding negative. Profit target is 0.165215, and current price is very close to it (0.166865 vs 0.165215). The profit target might be hit soon. Since it's a short, and price is near target, I should consider if I need to close or hold. But the signal is to hold unless invalidation or targets hit. The profit target is set, so it will auto-close when hit. I should just hold.\n\nNow, for new entries: I need to check if there are any opportunities. I have available cash of 3227.96. I should only enter if I see a good opportunity with confidence.\n\nLook at each coin not in my positions: SOL and BNB are not in my current positions. I have ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, so missing SOL and BNB.\n\nCheck SOL:\n\n- Current price 166.635, EMA20 171.956, so price below EMA. MACD negative. RSI 22.289, oversold. Funding negative. Open interest high. Price has been dropping. Might be a buying opportunity for a bounce. But I need to see if it exceeds trading costs.\n\nSimilarly, BNB: current price 981.315, EMA20 1003.395, price below EMA. MACD negative. RSI 29.567, oversold. Funding negative. Could be a buy.\n\nBut I already have four positions, and I should avoid over-trading. The instructions say to maximize PnL while avoiding over-trading. I have limited cash, and entering new positions might dilute or increase risk.\n\nI need to decide if I should enter SOL or BNB. But first, I must check my existing positions' exit plans. For all existing positions, none of the invalidation conditions are triggered. Current prices are above stop losses and invalidation levels for longs, and for DOGE short, price is below stop and invalidation.\n\nFor DOGE, profit target is very close. Current price 0.166865, profit target 0.165215. Difference is about 0.00165, which is small. Since it's a short, profit target is below current, so when price drops to 0.165215, it will close. But currently, it's not hit. I should hold.\n\nNow, for new entries: I need to see if there's alpha. But with current market, all coins seem oversold, so perhaps buying opportunities. But I already have long positions in ETH, XRP, BTC, which are also oversold. Adding more longs might increase correlation risk.\n\nPerhaps I should not enter new positions since I'm already exposed to the market downturn. Or if I see a particularly good setup.\n\nCheck confidence: For SOL, RSI is 22.289, which is oversold, but similar to others. MACD is negative but might be bottoming? Looking at intraday MACD: it's becoming more negative: -2.123 latest, previous -1.918, so still falling. Not sure.\n\nSimilarly for BNB.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on managing existing positions.\n\nThe instruction: \"For any coin you manage or want to enter, choose exactly one action\". I have to output for each coin I act on or hold an existing position in.\n\nSo, for coins where I have positions: ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, I need to output either 'hold' or 'close_position'. Since no invalidation, I should hold.\n\nFor coins without positions: SOL and BNB, I can choose to enter or do nothing. If I do nothing, I don't output anything for them? No, the output should be a JSON object for each coin that I act on or have a position in. So for coins where I have positions, I must output. For coins without, if I don't act, I don't output anything. The instruction says: \"For each coin you act on during this invocation (or hold an existing position in), provide below.\" So if I have a position, I must output, even if I hold. If I don't have a position and I don't act, I don't output.\n\nSo for SOL and BNB, if I decide not to enter, I don't include them in the output.\n\nBut I need to consider if there's a good entry.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the actions for existing positions.\n\nFor ETH: signal should be 'hold'. Quantity is full current size, which is 5.98. I need to provide profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd from the exit plan.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThe JSON for 'hold' requires all those fields. From the account info, I have them for each position.\n\nFor example, for ETH: profit_target=3947.075, stop_loss=3408.8375, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.85, risk_usd=1075.578.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for DOGE, it's a short, so profit_target is lower, stop_loss is higher. But in the JSON, for 'hold', I just provide the values as is.\n\nNow, for new entries, if I want to enter SOL or BNB.\n\nLet's assess SOL.\n\nCurrent price: 166.635\n\nI need to decide margin, leverage, etc.\n\nFirst, confidence: RSI is 22.289, which is oversold. Price below EMA. MACD negative but might be oversold. Funding negative, which is good for longs. However, the trend is down. But oversold bounce might happen.\n\nI need to set a confidence. Perhaps 0.65? Since RSI is low, but not extremely low like ETH's 10.325. ETH has RSI 10, which is more oversold.\n\nCompare RSI: ETH RSI7=10.325, SOL RSI7=22.289, so ETH is more oversold. Similarly, BTC RSI7=22.016, XRP=27.561, so SOL is similar to BTC.\n\nPerhaps confidence around 0.6-0.7.\n\nBut I already have long positions, so adding another long might not diversify. Also, available cash is 3227.96, which is about 31% of account value (10322.34), so I have some cash, but if I enter, I should use significant margin.\n\nThe instruction: \"Skip trades where margin < 5% of available cash.\" So margin must be at least 0.05 * 3227.96 ≈ 161.4 USD.\n\nBut also, \"Do not even bother entering small positions that only use <5% of your available cash on margin or risk_usd\" – it says margin or risk_usd? Let's read: \"Don’t even bother entering small positions that only use <5% of your available cash on margin or risk_usd\" – probably means that margin should be at least 5% of available cash, and risk_usd might be a fraction, but the skip condition is margin < 5% of available cash.\n\nFrom sizing: \"Skip trades where margin < 5% of available cash. Require: 0.05 × available_cash ≤ margin ≤ available_cash.\"\n\nSo margin must be at least 161.4 USD.\n\nNow, for confidence, if I set confidence 0.65, margin should be 10-20% of available cash. Available cash is 3227.96, so 10% is 322.8, 20% is 645.6. So margin between 322.8 and 645.6 USD for confidence 0.65.\n\nLeverage for SOL: max leverage is 20x, min 5x. I should use at least 5x.\n\nThen notional = margin * leverage.\n\nThen quantity = notional / entry_price.\n\nRisk_usd = r * margin, with r between 0.2 and 0.8.\n\nThen stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity.\n\nFor long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance.\n\nProfit_target should be set such that |entry_price - profit_target| is a multiple of stop_distance. Typically, risk-reward ratio, say 2:1 or 3:1.\n\nBut I need to justify the entry.\n\nSimilarly for BNB.\n\nBut I think with existing positions, and market being bearish, perhaps I should not enter new positions. My existing longs are underwater, but I'm holding for a bounce. Adding more might increase risk.\n\nPerhaps I should close some positions if invalidation is near, but currently, prices are above stop losses.\n\nFor example, XRP stop loss is 2.325, current price 2.33385, very close. If price drops slightly, it might hit stop loss. But invalidation is at 2.30, which is lower. So stop loss is set, and it will auto-close if hit.\n\nSimilarly, for DOGE, profit target is close.\n\nI should just hold all existing positions and not enter new ones.\n\nFor SOL and BNB, I might miss opportunities, but with four positions, it might be better to manage existing.\n\nThe instruction is to discover alpha, but I need to avoid over-trading.\n\nPerhaps I can enter one if very confident.\n\nLook at ETH: RSI is 10.325, which is extremely oversold. That might be a better buy than SOL or BNB, but I already have a long in ETH.\n\nI could increase size, but the instruction says \"No pyramiding or size increases.\" So I cannot add to existing positions; I can only enter new if flat, or close.\n\nSo for ETH, I'm already in, so only hold or close.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for new entries, only for coins I'm flat in: SOL and BNB.\n\nNow, assess SOL vs BNB.\n\nSOL: current price 166.635, EMA20 171.956, difference about 5.32, which is about 3.1% below EMA. RSI 22.29, oversold. MACD negative. Funding negative. ATR on 4h is 2.274, so volatility is moderate.\n\nBNB: current price 981.315, EMA20 1003.395, difference about 22.08, which is about 2.25% below EMA. RSI 29.567, less oversold than SOL. MACD negative. Funding negative. ATR on 4h is 10.139, so price move of about 1%.\n\nSOL has lower RSI, so more oversold. But BNB has larger absolute price, but percentage similar.\n\nPerhaps SOL has better bounce potential.\n\nBut I need to set up a trade.\n\nIf I enter SOL long.\n\nConfidence: let's say 0.65, since RSI oversold but not extreme.\n\nMargin: for confidence 0.65, margin 10-20% of available cash. Available cash 3227.96, so say 15% = 484.194 USD.\n\nLeverage: use 10x? Min 5x, max 20x for SOL. Use 10x for consistency with existing positions.\n\nNotional = margin * leverage = 484.194 * 10 = 4841.94 USD.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 4841.94 / 166.635 ≈ 29.06 SOL. (calculate: 166.635 * 29 = 4832.415, close enough, but better to compute exactly.\n\n166.635 * 29.06 = let's calculate: 166.635 * 29 = 4832.415, 166.635 * 0.06 = 9.9981, total 4842.4131, so quantity ≈ 29.06.\n\nNow risk_usd: r * margin, with r between 0.2 and 0.8. Say r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 484.194 ≈ 242.097 USD.\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 242.097 / 29.06 ≈ 8.33 USD per SOL? Price is in USD, so stop_distance in USD.\n\nstop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 242.097 / 29.06 ≈ 8.33. But price is 166.635, so stop distance in price terms.\n\nFor long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance, so stop_loss = 166.635 - 8.33 ≈ 158.305.\n\nBut is that reasonable? ATR on 3-minute? The ATR given is for 4h: 3-period ATR 2.783, 14-period 2.274, so daily volatility is small. But stop distance of 8.33 is about 5% of price, which might be too wide? Or narrow? ATR 2.274 for 4h, but 4h ATR is for longer term. Intraday, the price moves: looking at intraday prices for SOL: from 174.9 to 166.635, so drop of about 8.265 over 9 intervals (27 minutes?), but each step is 3-min, so 9*3=27 min, price dropped 8.265, so volatility is high.\n\nPerhaps stop should be based on ATR. But I need to set stop_loss such that it's not too tight.\n\nProfit_target: should be multiple of stop_distance. Say risk-reward 2:1, so profit distance = 2 * stop_distance = 2*8.33=16.66, so profit_target = entry_price + profit_distance = 166.635 + 16.66 ≈ 183.295.\n\nBut is that realistic? EMA20 is 171.956, so above that, but 183 is higher. Might be possible if bounce.\n\nBut I need justification.\n\nSimilarly for BNB.\n\nBut I think I'm not highly confident. Moreover, with existing positions, I should hold.\n\nPerhaps I should not enter new positions.\n\nNow, for DOGE, profit target is very close. Current price 0.166865, profit target 0.165215, difference 0.00165, which is about 1% drop. It might hit soon. But since it's set, I should hold and let it close automatically.\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nI think for this invocation, I should hold all existing positions and not enter new ones.\n\nSo output JSON for ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE with signal 'hold', and for SOL and BNB, no output since I'm not acting.\n\nBut let's confirm the invalidation conditions.\n\nFor XRP, current price 2.33385, stop loss 2.325, very close. If price drops below 2.325, stop loss will hit. But currently, it's above, so hold.\n\nSimilarly, for DOGE, profit target close.\n\nBut no reason to close early.\n\nSo decisions:\n\n- ETH: hold\n\n- XRP: hold\n\n- BTC: hold\n\n- DOGE: hold\n\n- SOL: no action\n\n- BNB: no action\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to provide for each coin I have a position in.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin, but the example shows {\"COIN\": { \"trade_signal_args\": {...} } }\n\nSo I need to output a JSON object that has keys for ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE.\n\nAnd for each, the trade_signal_args with signal 'hold', and the required fields.\n\nFrom the account info, I have all the values: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI need to copy those exactly as per the exit plan.\n\nFor example, for ETH:\n\n\"ETH\": {\n  \"trade_signal_args\": {\n    \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n    \"signal\": \"hold\",\n    \"quantity\": 5.98,\n    \"profit_target\": 3947.075,\n    \"stop_loss\": 3408.8375,\n    \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle\",\n    \"leverage\": 10,\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"risk_usd\": 1075.578\n  }\n}\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in the account info, for XRP, it has profit_target=2.815, stop_loss=2.325, etc.\n\nFor DOGE, since it's short, profit_target is 0.165215, which is below, and stop_loss is 0.192755, above.\n\nBut in the JSON, I just provide the numbers as is; the direction is implied by the signal, but for hold, it's fine.\n\nAlso, for justification: in the 'hold' JSON, there is no justification field? Look at the examples.\n\nFor 'hold', the example does not have \"justification\", but for entry and close, it does.\n\nCheck the examples:\n\nFor Entry/Exit: has \"justification\"\n\nFor Close: has \"justification\"\n\nFor Hold: does not have \"justification\" in the example.\n\nLook back:\n\n**If Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n\t  \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n\t  \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNo \"justification\" for hold. Only for entry and close.\n\nSo for hold, I don't need to provide justification.\n\nSimilarly, for close, I need justification, but I'm not closing.\n\nSo for my output, for each coin with hold, no justification.\n\nNow, for the JSON structure, I need to output a single JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo something like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"XRP\": { ... },\n  \"BTC\": { ... },\n  \"DOGE\": { ... }\n}\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nNow, double-check the values from account info.\n\nFor ETH: quantity=5.98, profit_target=3947.075, stop_loss=3408.8375, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.85, risk_usd=1075.578\n\nFor XRP: quantity=3609.0, profit_target=2.815, stop_loss=2.325, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.65, risk_usd=442.032\n\nFor BTC: quantity=0.12, profit_target=118136.15, stop_loss=102026.675, invalidation_condition='If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.75, risk_usd=619.2345\n\nFor DOGE: quantity=-100230.0, profit_target=0.165215, stop_loss=0.192755, invalidation_condition='If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle', leverage=10, confidence=0.7, risk_usd=920.034\n\nNote: for DOGE, quantity is negative because it's short. But in the JSON, for hold, I think I should provide the absolute quantity? No, the example says \"quantity\": <full current size>, and in the account info, it's given as negative for short, so I should keep it negative to indicate direction? But in the signal, for hold, it might not matter, but probably I should provide the signed quantity as per the position.\n\nIn the entry example, for sell_to_enter, quantity is positive, but direction is handled by signal. For hold, since the position exists, quantity should be the current size, which for short is negative.\n\nIn the account info, it's given as negative for DOGE.\n\nIn the close example, quantity is full current size, which could be negative.\n\nSo I think I should provide the signed quantity.\n\nSimilarly, for profit_target and stop_loss, for short, profit_target is below, stop_loss above, but I provide the numbers as is.\n\nSo for DOGE, quantity: -100230.0\n\nNow, for the JSON, I need to make sure the numbers are floats, etc.\n\nFinally, output only JSON, no prose.\n\nSo my output should be a JSON object with four keys: ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, each with the trade_signal_args for hold.\n\nNo action for SOL and BNB, so not included.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding onto my ETH, XRP, BTC, and DOGE positions because the current market conditions suggest a short-term consolidation and potential bounces from oversold levels, with no immediate invalidation signals triggering my exit plans. While SOL and BNB presented potential oversold entry opportunities, I'm prioritizing risk management by focusing on my existing positions rather than adding new ones and diluting my portfolio."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. From the account information, I have three positions:\n\n1. ETH: Long position, quantity 5.98, entry price 3595.2, current price 3587.35. Unrealized PnL is -46.94. Exit plan includes profit target at 3947.075, stop loss at 3408.8375, and invalidation condition if price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle. Confidence is 0.85, risk_usd is 1075.578.\n\n2. BTC: Long position, quantity 0.12, entry price 107343.0, current price 105624.5. Unrealized PnL is -206.22. Exit plan has profit target at 118136.15, stop loss at 102026.675, and invalidation condition if price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle. Confidence is 0.75, risk_usd is 619.2345.\n\n3. DOGE: Short position, quantity -100230.0, entry price 0.18, current price 0.166785. Unrealized PnL is positive 1665.02. Exit plan has profit target at 0.165215 (which is below current price, so for a short, that might be correct – profit target is lower than entry for short), stop loss at 0.192755, and invalidation condition if price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle. Confidence is 0.7, risk_usd is 920.034.\n\nFor each coin, I need to decide on an action: hold or close_position. I should not enter new positions in these coins since I already have positions. The instructions say: \"If a position is open in a coin, the only allowed signals are 'hold' or 'close_position'.\"\n\nI need to check if any invalidation conditions have been triggered or if I should close based on new data.\n\nLet's review the current market data for each coin relative to the exit plans.\n\nStarting with ETH:\n\n- Current price: 3587.35\n\n- Stop loss: 3408.8375 – current price is above stop loss, so not hit.\n\n- Invalidation condition: if price closes below 3400. Current price is 3587.35, which is well above 3400. Looking at the intraday series, the last price is 3587.35, and previous prices are around 3590s, so no close below 3400. Invalidation not triggered.\n\n- RSI is low at 17.125, which is oversold, but that might be a reason to hold if I believe in a bounce. My confidence was high at 0.85 when entered.\n\n- EMA20 is 3641.209, current price below EMA, but MACD is negative, RSI oversold. Might be near a bottom.\n\n- Funding rate is negative, which is good for longs (since I'm long, I receive funding).\n\n- Open interest is slightly down from average, no big deal.\n\nI think for ETH, I should hold. No reason to close yet.\n\nNow BTC:\n\n- Current price: 105624.5\n\n- Stop loss: 102026.675 – current price above stop loss.\n\n- Invalidation condition: if price closes below 105000. Current price is 105624.5, which is above 105000. Looking at intraday prices, last few are around 105600-106000, so no close below 105000. Not triggered.\n\n- RSI is 22.439, oversold. EMA20 is 106531.153, current price below, MACD negative. Similar to ETH, might be oversold.\n\n- Funding negative, good for longs.\n\n- Unrealized loss is -206.22, but I should not close based on PnL alone; stick to the plan.\n\nI think hold for BTC as well.\n\nNow DOGE:\n\n- I'm short DOGE.\n\n- Current price: 0.166785\n\n- Profit target: 0.165215 – current price is 0.166785, which is above profit target? For a short, profit is when price goes down. Profit target should be below entry price. Entry is 0.18, current is 0.166785, so I'm in profit. Profit target is set at 0.165215, which is lower than current, so if price hits 0.165215, I should profit and exit. But current price is 0.166785, so not yet hit.\n\n- Stop loss: 0.192755 – current price is below stop loss, so safe.\n\n- Invalidation condition: if price closes above 0.195. Current price is 0.166785, far below, so not triggered.\n\n- RSI is 35.929, not extremely oversold or overbought. EMA20 is 0.17, current below, MACD negative. Might continue down.\n\n- Funding negative, which for a short, I pay funding? No, funding rate is paid by longs to shorts if positive, but here funding is negative, so shorts pay longs? Actually, negative funding means longs pay shorts, so as a short, I receive funding when it's negative? Let's confirm: in perpetual futures, if funding rate is negative, shorts pay longs? No, standard is that when funding rate is positive, longs pay shorts; when negative, shorts pay longs. So for DOGE, funding rate is -2.63761e-05, which is negative, so as a short, I would pay funding? Actually, no: if funding rate is negative, it means the perpetual is trading at a discount to spot, so shorts pay longs. But in terms of PnL, if I'm short, a negative funding rate means I have to pay, which is a cost. But the rate is very small, so negligible.\n\nBut in this case, for DOGE, funding is slightly negative, so as a short, it might be a small cost, but not significant.\n\nCurrent PnL is positive, and price is moving down. I should hold.\n\nNow, are there any coins I don't have positions in? The tradable tokens are ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. I have positions in ETH, BTC, DOGE. So I might consider entering SOL, XRP, or BNB.\n\nBut I need to check if I should enter any new positions. The instructions say: \"For any coin you manage or want to enter, choose exactly one action.\" So for coins I have positions, I decide hold or close. For others, I can consider buy_to_enter or sell_to_enter.\n\nBut I should only enter if I see a good opportunity, and considering fees and funding.\n\nAlso, I have available cash of 3661.89. I need to ensure that for any new entry, margin is at least 5% of available cash, which is 0.05 * 3661.89 ≈ 183.0945 USD. And margin should be less than or equal to available cash.\n\nNow, let's look at the coins I don't have positions: SOL, XRP, BNB.\n\nFirst, SOL:\n\n- Current price: 166.505\n\n- EMA20: 170.187, current below EMA.\n\n- MACD: -2.432, negative.\n\n- RSI 7-period: 23.941, oversold.\n\n- Funding rate: -9.72361e-05, negative.\n\n- Open interest: slightly down from average.\n\n- Longer-term: EMA20 < EMA50 on 4-hour, bearish trend.\n\nRSI is oversold, might be a buying opportunity. But trend is down. I need to see if there's alpha.\n\nSimilarly, XRP:\n\n- Current price: 2.32695\n\n- EMA20: 2.366, current below.\n\n- MACD: -0.022, negative.\n\n- RSI 7-period: 27.526, near oversold.\n\n- Funding negative.\n\n- Trend down on 4-hour.\n\nBNB:\n\n- Current price: 980.26\n\n- EMA20: 995.923, current below.\n\n- MACD: -10.275, negative.\n\n- RSI 7-period: 31.897, not very oversold.\n\n- Funding negative.\n\nAll coins seem to be in downtrends with oversold conditions. I might consider buying opportunities for a bounce.\n\nBut I need to be cautious because the market is bearish. My existing positions are longs in ETH and BTC, which are losing, and short in DOGE which is winning. Perhaps I should not add more longs until trend changes.\n\nThe instructions say: \"discovering alpha\". Alpha might mean mean reversion or trend following. Given oversold conditions, mean reversion might work.\n\nBut I need to justify each trade.\n\nAlso, for entry, I need to set margin, leverage, risk_usd, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation.\n\nFirst, I need to decide if I want to enter any new position.\n\nLet me check my current account: available cash is 3661.89, and I have three positions. I should not over-leverage. The positions have notional values: ETH 21452.35, BTC 12674.94, DOGE 16716.86. Total notional is about 50844.15, account value 10290.74, so leverage is about 4.94x overall? Notional / account value = 50844.15 / 10290.74 ≈ 4.94, which is less than 5, but I have cash available. But I should be careful not to over-trade.\n\nPerhaps I should not enter new positions since I already have three, and wait for existing ones to play out.\n\nBut the system allows me to enter if I see opportunity. I need to see if there's a clear signal.\n\nLooking at SOL: RSI very oversold at 23.94, price below EMA, but MACD negative. Might be a good bounce candidate.\n\nSimilarly, XRP RSI 27.53, oversold.\n\nBNB RSI 31.90, less oversold.\n\nPerhaps SOL is the most oversold.\n\nBut I need to set up the trade properly.\n\nIf I enter, I need confidence level to determine margin.\n\nFor example, if I think SOL might bounce, confidence might be moderate, say 0.65? Then margin should be 10-20% of available cash. Available cash is 3661.89, so 10% is 366.189, 20% is 732.378. So margin between 366 and 732 USD.\n\nThen risk_usd should be a fraction of margin, say r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * margin.\n\nLeverage: for SOL, max leverage is 20x, min 5x. I should use at least 5x.\n\nThen notional = margin * leverage.\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price.\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity.\n\nFor long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance.\n\nProfit_target should be set such that reward/risk ratio is good, say 2:1 or more. So if stop_distance is S, profit_target should be entry_price + 2*S or something.\n\nSimilarly for short.\n\nBut I need to justify why I expect the move.\n\nAlso, invalidation_condition should be specific.\n\nBut first, I need to decide if I enter.\n\nPerhaps I should not enter new positions now because the market is bearish, and my existing longs are underwater. Adding more longs might increase risk. Instead, I should manage existing positions.\n\nMoreover, the instructions say: \"avoid over-trading by discovering alpha.\" I might not have clear alpha for new entries.\n\nFor existing positions, I should hold unless invalidation triggers.\n\nLet me double-check the invalidation conditions for existing positions.\n\nETH: invalidation if price closes below 3400. Current price 3587.35, last intraday prices: from the series, the last 10 prices are from 3655.45 down to 3587.35, all above 3400. So no close below 3400. Hold.\n\nBTC: invalidation if closes below 105000. Current 105624.5, last prices: 106226, 105834, etc., all above 105000. So hold.\n\nDOGE: invalidation if closes above 0.195. Current 0.166785, last prices around 0.166-0.173, all below 0.195. So hold.\n\nAlso, for DOGE, profit target is 0.165215, current is 0.166785, so almost there. But not yet hit. I should hold until target or stop.\n\nSo for all existing positions, I should hold.\n\nFor other coins, I decide not to enter now, as I don't have strong conviction.\n\nBut the system requires me to output JSON for each coin I act on or have a position in. So I need to output for ETH, BTC, DOGE with hold signal.\n\nFor SOL, XRP, BNB, if I don't act, I don't need to output anything? Let's read the instructions.\n\n\"Output a JSON object for each coin that you either act on (i.e. buy_to_enter, sell_to_enter, close_position), OR, for existing positions, you should return a json object for each coin with the signal 'hold'.\"\n\nSo for coins with existing positions, I must output hold JSON. For coins without positions, if I don't act, I don't output anything. So only output for coins where I have a position or where I enter/exit.\n\nIn this case, I have positions in ETH, BTC, DOGE, so I need to output hold for each.\n\nFor SOL, XRP, BNB, I am not entering, so no output.\n\nBut let me confirm if I should enter any. Perhaps BNB or XRP might be opportunities, but I think it's better to hold off.\n\nAnother thing: the funding rates are negative for all, which is favorable for longs, but the trend is down, so perhaps not good for longs. For shorts, negative funding is a cost, so not ideal.\n\nIn DOGE, I'm short with negative funding, so I might be paying a small cost, but since price is down, it's ok.\n\nI think I'll stick to holding existing positions.\n\nSo for the output, I need to provide JSON for ETH, BTC, DOGE with hold signal.\n\nFor hold, the JSON requires quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd. These should be the same as when I entered, since I'm not changing them. The instructions say for hold, supply the current values.\n\nLooking at the account info, for each position, I have the exit_plan which includes profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and also leverage, confidence, risk_usd are given.\n\nSo for hold, I should use the existing values.\n\nSimilarly, quantity is the current size.\n\nSo for each coin, I can copy from the account info.\n\nBut note: for DOGE, the position is short, but in the JSON, for hold, it should still have quantity as negative? Let's see the example: for hold, quantity is the full current size. In account, DOGE quantity is -100230.0, so I should use that.\n\nIn the JSON, for hold, it doesn't specify direction, but quantity has sign.\n\nIn the entry JSON, for buy_to_enter, quantity is positive, for sell_to_enter, quantity is negative? The instruction says: \"For entries, set quantity > 0 (regardless of direction, direction sign is handled downstream).\" So for entry, quantity is always positive, and signal indicates direction.\n\nBut for hold and close, quantity is the current size, which could be negative for short positions.\n\nIn the account, DOGE has quantity -100230.0, so for hold, I should use that negative quantity.\n\nSimilarly, for close_position, quantity should be the current size with sign.\n\nIn the examples, for close and hold, quantity is specified as full current size, so it should include the sign.\n\nIn the account info, for DOGE, it's negative, so I'll use that.\n\nNow, for the JSON, I need to output one JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object where each key is the coin symbol, and value is another object with trade_signal_args.\n\nSo overall, something like:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"BTC\": { ... },\n  \"DOGE\": { ... }\n}\n\nAnd for each, the trade_signal_args with the fields.\n\nFor hold, the justification is not required? Look at the hold example: it does not have a \"justification\" field. Compare the examples:\n\n- For entry/exit: has \"justification\"\n\n- For close: has \"justification\"\n\n- For hold: does not have \"justification\" in the example.\n\nCheck the instruction:\n\n**If Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n\t  \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n\t  \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYes, for hold, there is no \"justification\" field. For entry and close, there is.\n\nSo for hold, I don't need to provide justification.\n\nSimilarly, for close, I need justification, but for hold, no.\n\nSo for my output, for ETH, BTC, DOGE, I'll output hold with the existing values.\n\nNow, I need to get the values from the account info.\n\nFor ETH:\n\n- coin: \"ETH\"\n\n- signal: \"hold\"\n\n- quantity: 5.98 (from account)\n\n- profit_target: 3947.075 (from exit_plan)\n\n- stop_loss: 3408.8375 (from exit_plan)\n\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle\" (from exit_plan)\n\n- leverage: 10 (from account)\n\n- confidence: 0.85 (from account)\n\n- risk_usd: 1075.578 (from account)\n\nSimilarly for BTC:\n\n- coin: \"BTC\"\n\n- signal: \"hold\"\n\n- quantity: 0.12\n\n- profit_target: 118136.15\n\n- stop_loss: 102026.675\n\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\n- leverage: 10\n\n- confidence: 0.75\n\n- risk_usd: 619.2345\n\nFor DOGE:\n\n- coin: \"DOGE\"\n\n- signal: \"hold\"\n\n- quantity: -100230.0  (negative since short)\n\n- profit_target: 0.165215\n\n- stop_loss: 0.192755\n\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\n- leverage: 10\n\n- confidence: 0.7\n\n- risk_usd: 920.034\n\nI think that's it.\n\nI should not output for other coins.\n\nSo the JSON output should have three keys: ETH, BTC, DOGE.\n\nNow, to write it compactly.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding my ETH, BTC, and DOGE positions as their invalidation conditions haven't been met and the market is presenting oversold conditions across the board, suggesting potential for mean reversion. My short DOGE position is currently profitable, and while ETH and BTC longs are underwater, their current prices are above their stop losses and they show signs of being oversold, making holding the prudent strategy for now."

No reason to close.\n- Hold.\n\nBTC:\n- Current price: 106153.5\n- Entry price: 107343.0, so negative PnL.\n- Exit plan: Stop loss at 102026.675, invalidation: price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle.\n- Current price is 106153.5, which is above 105000, and stop loss is below.\n- RSI(7) is 58.924, improving from lows. EMA is 106167.098, close to price.\n- However, BTC has been volatile, but no invalidation hit. I should hold unless invalidation triggers.\n\nDOGE:\n- I have a short position: quantity -100230, entry price 0.18, current price 0.168535, so profit.\n- Exit plan: Profit target at 0.165215, stop loss at 0.192755. Invalidation: price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle.\n- Current price is 0.168535, which is below stop loss and above profit target.\n- RSI(7) is 55.923, not too high. Price seems to be consolidating.\n- No invalidation hit. I should hold.\n\nBNB:\n- Current price: 993.54\n- Entry price: 990.91, small profit.\n- Exit plan: Profit target at 1088.135, stop loss at 939.755. Invalidation: RSI(7) falls below 40.\n- Current RSI(7) is 62.655, well above 40, and price is above stop loss.\n- Price is rising, RSI strong. Hold.\n\nNow, for new trades: I need to see if there are any opportunities to enter new positions. I have available cash of 2375.1. I should only enter if there's a good opportunity that exceeds trading costs.\n\nLooking at the coins I'm not in: I'm already in all tradable coins except SOL. I don't have a position in SOL.\n\nCheck SOL for potential entry:\n- Current price: 168.305\n- EMA20: 168.815, so price is slightly below EMA.\n- MACD: -1.851, negative but improving (from -2.242 to -1.851, turning up).\n- RSI(7): 55.828, which is neutral to bullish.\n- Longer-term: EMA20 4h is 182.627, EMA50 187.417, so below both, but intraday showing recovery.\n- Volume: current 4723.15 vs avg 676813.142, low volume, might not be strong.\n- Funding rate: -9.63642e-05, slightly negative, not too bad.\n- Open interest: high, around 4.78M.\n\nSOL price has been rising in the last few candles: from 166.045 to 168.305. RSI improving. MACD turning up. Could be a bounce from oversold levels.\n\nBut I need to assess confidence. RSI was low and now recovering. Let me estimate confidence.\n\nFor entry, if I go long, I need to set margin, leverage, risk_usd, etc.\n\nFirst, decide if I want to enter. SOL seems to be showing signs of reversal. Price above recent lows, RSI from 20s to 55, MACD improving.\n\nConfidence: I'd say moderate, around 0.65-0.7.\n\nMargin: For confidence 0.65, suggested margin 10-20% of available cash. Available cash is 2375.1, so 10% is 237.51, 20% is 475.02.\n\nI should use at least 5% of available cash, which is 118.755, so minimum margin 118.755.\n\nSet margin: let's say I use 15% of available cash, so margin = 0.15 * 2375.1 = 356.265\n\nLeverage for SOL: max is 20x, I'll use 10x for safety.\n\nRisk_usd: fraction of margin, say r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 356.265 = 178.1325\n\nThen, notional = margin * leverage = 356.265 * 10 = 3562.65\n\nQuantity = notional / entry_price = 3562.65 / 168.305 ≈ 21.17 (let's calculate: 3562.65 / 168.305 ≈ 21.17)\n\nStop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 178.1325 / 21.17 ≈ 8.42\n\nFor long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 168.305 - 8.42 ≈ 159.885\n\nProfit_target: should be a multiple of stop_distance. Say 2:1 ratio, so target distance = 2 * 8.42 = 16.84, so profit_target = entry_price + target_distance = 168.305 + 16.84 ≈ 185.145\n\nCheck if realistic: longer-term EMAs are around 182-187, so 185 is below EMA50, might be reasonable.\n\nInvalidation_condition: if price closes below 159 on a 3-minute candle or something.\n\nBut I need to justify the entry.\n\nJustification: SOL is showing bullish momentum with rising price, improving RSI and MACD from oversold levels. Expected to continue upwards towards resistance.\n\nConfidence: I'll set at 0.65.\n\nNow, for existing positions, I need to output hold signals with their full details.\n\nFor each coin I'm in, I must output the JSON with signal 'hold', and include all the fields: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI have the current values from the account info.\n\nFor ETH: quantity 5.98, profit_target 3947.075, stop_loss 3408.8375, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.85, risk_usd 1075.578\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nXRP: quantity 4663, profit_target 2.46767, stop_loss 2.29139, invalidation_condition \"If RSI(7) falls below 45\", leverage 20, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 274.642\n\nBTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity -100230 (short), profit_target 0.165215, stop_loss 0.192755, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 920.034\n\nBNB: quantity 7.4, profit_target 1088.135, stop_loss 939.755, invalidation_condition \"If RSI(7) falls below 40\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 366.189\n\nFor DOGE, since it's short, the stop_loss is above entry, which is correct for short.\n\nNow, for SOL entry, I need to output buy_to_enter.\n\nSignal: buy_to_enter\n\nQuantity: as calculated, 21.17, but I need to use precise calculation.\n\nentry_price is current_price 168.305\n\nnotional = margin * leverage = 356.265 * 10 = 3562.65\n\nquantity = notional / entry_price = 3562.65 / 168.305 ≈ 21.170 (let's keep two decimals)\n\nIn JSON, quantity should be float.\n\nstop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 178.1325 / 21.17 ≈ 8.416 (calculate exactly)\n\nBetter to calculate with exact numbers.\n\nSet margin = 356.265 (15% of 2375.1)\n\nleverage = 10\n\nnotional = 3562.65\n\nquantity = 3562.65 / 168.305 = let's compute: 168.305 * 21.17 = 168.305 * 20 = 3366.1, 168.305 * 1.17 = 196.91685, total 3562.01685, close to 3562.65, so approximately 21.17\n\nExactly: 3562.65 / 168.305 ≈ 21.170 (use 21.17)\n\nrisk_usd = 178.1325\n\nstop_distance = 178.1325 / 21.17 ≈ 8.416\n\nstop_loss = 168.305 - 8.416 = 159.889\n\nprofit_target distance: say 2:1 ratio, so 2 * 8.416 = 16.832\n\nprofit_target = 168.305 + 16.832 = 185.137\n\nInvalidation: perhaps \"If price closes below 159 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nConfidence: 0.65\n\nJustification: \"SOL is exhibiting a bullish reversal with price breaking above recent resistance, RSI recovering from oversold levels, and MACD turning positive. Expect continuation towards the 185 level.\"\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I act on or hold.\n\nI should output for all coins I have positions in, with hold, and for SOL with buy_to_enter.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, for ETH, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB, I output hold, and for SOL, buy_to_enter.\n\nIn the JSON, for hold and close, I need to include justification, but looking back at the instructions:\n\nFor hold: in the JSON example, it doesn't have justification for hold, only for entry and close.\n\nCheck the instructions:\n\n**If Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n\t  \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n\t  \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt doesn't include justification for hold. Only for entry and close, justification is required.\n\nIn the entry example, justification is part of trade_signal_args.\n\nFor hold, no justification field.\n\nSimilarly, for close, justification is required.\n\nIn my case, for hold positions, I don't need to provide justification, just the data.\n\nFor SOL entry, I need justification.\n\nAlso, for existing positions, the quantity is the full current size, which is given.\n\nNow, for DOGE, it's a short position, but in the JSON, quantity is negative for short? No, in the instructions, for entry, quantity is positive, and signal indicates direction.\n\nIn the account info, DOGE quantity is -100230, meaning short.\n\nBut in the output JSON, for hold, I should use the absolute quantity or signed?\n\nLook at the JSON examples: for hold, quantity is <full current size>, and in the account, it's given with sign.\n\nIn the close example, quantity is full current size, which could be negative for short.\n\nIn the entry, quantity is positive, and signal buy or sell indicates direction.\n\nFor hold and close, I should use the signed quantity as is.\n\nIn the JSON, for DOGE, quantity should be -100230.\n\nSimilarly, for entry, if I sell_to_enter, quantity is positive, but signal is sell_to_enter.\n\nIn this case, for SOL, I'm buying, so quantity positive.\n\nNow, back to SOL entry confidence: I set margin based on confidence, but I don't output margin, only risk_usd, leverage, etc.\n\nI think I have everything.\n\nNow, output JSON.\n\nFirst, for existing positions:\n\nETH: hold with given values.\n\nXRP: hold.\n\nBTC: hold.\n\nDOGE: hold with quantity -100230.\n\nBNB: hold.\n\nThen for SOL: buy_to_enter.\n\nCalculate exact numbers for SOL.\n\nAvailable cash: 2375.1\n\nMargin: I chose 15%, so 0.15 * 2375.1 = 356.265\n\nLeverage: 10x (max for SOL is 20, but use 10 for safety)\n\nNotional: 356.265 * 10 = 3562.65\n\nEntry price: 168.305\n\nQuantity: 3562.65 / 168.305 ≈ 21.170 (let's use 21.17)\n\nRisk_usd: I set r=0.5, so risk_usd = 0.5 * 356.265 = 178.1325\n\nStop_distance: risk_usd / quantity = 178.1325 / 21.17 ≈ 8.416 (calculate: 178.1325 / 21.17 = 8.416, yes)\n\nStop_loss for long: entry_price - stop_distance = 168.305 - 8.416 = 159.889\n\nProfit_target: with 2:1 ratio, target distance = 2 * 8.416 = 16.832\n\nProfit_target = 168.305 + 16.832 = 185.137\n\nInvalidation_condition: \"If price closes below 159 on a 3-minute candle\"\n\nConfidence: 0.65\n\nJustification: \"SOL is showing a bullish reversal with price increase from oversold levels, improving RSI and MACD. Expect a move towards the 185 resistance area.\"\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to have one JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, the output should be:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"XRP\": { ... },\n  \"BTC\": { ... },\n  \"DOGE\": { ... },\n  \"BNB\": { ... },\n  \"SOL\": { ... }\n}\n\nFor SOL, it's an entry, so use the entry format.\n\nI need to make sure that for hold, I don't include justification.\n\nIn the hold JSON example, no justification field.\n\nSimilarly, in the account info, the exit_plan has invalidation_condition, which I should use.\n\nFor hold, I output the same invalidation_condition as in the account.\n\nNow, let's write the JSON.\n\nFirst, ETH:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.98,\n      \"profit_target\": 3947.075,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3408.8375,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.85,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1075.578\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nXRP:\n\n{\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 4663.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 2.46767,\n      \"stop_loss\": 2.29139,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) falls below 45\",\n      \"leverage\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 274.642\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nBTC:\n\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.12,\n      \"profit_target\": 118136.15,\n      \"stop_loss\": 102026.675,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 619.2345\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nDOGE:\n\n{\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": -100230.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.165215,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.192755,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 920.034\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nBNB:\n\n{\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 7.4,\n      \"profit_target\": 1088.135,\n      \"stop_loss\": 939.755,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) falls below 40\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 366.189\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNow for SOL entry:\n\n{\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"justification\": \"SOL is showing a bullish reversal with price increase from oversold levels, improving RSI and MACD.

For each, I must decide whether to hold or close based on their invalidation conditions and current market data.\n\nStart with ETH:\n- Current price: 3620.35\n- Entry price: 3595.2\n- Profit target: 3947.075\n- Stop loss: 3408.8375\n- Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle\n- Current RSI (7 period): 62.575, which is above 40, so not invalidating.\n- Price is above stop loss and moving up, RSI is healthy. No reason to close. I should hold.\n\nSOL:\n- Current price: 168.385\n- Entry price: 168.13\n- Profit target: 185.137\n- Stop loss: 159.889\n- Invalidation condition: If price closes below 159 on a 3-minute candle\n- Current price is above entry and stop loss. RSI (7 period): 55.366, not below any threshold. Should hold.\n\nXRP:\n- Current price: 2.36125\n- Entry price: 2.35\n- Profit target: 2.46767\n- Stop loss: 2.29139\n- Invalidation condition: If RSI(7) falls below 45\n- Current RSI (7 period): 64.821, which is well above 45. Price is above entry. Should hold.\n\nBTC:\n- Current price: 106412.5\n- Entry price: 107343.0\n- Unrealized PnL: -111.66 (loss)\n- Profit target: 118136.15\n- Stop loss: 102026.675\n- Invalidation condition: If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\n- Current price is 106412.5, which is above 105000. Last few prices: 105845.0, 105950.0, 106052.5, 106412.5 – all above 105000. RSI (7 period): 66.546, not low. MACD is improving (-363.934 from more negative values). Should hold, as it's recovering.\n\nDOGE:\n- I'm short DOGE.\n- Current price: 0.168625\n- Entry price: 0.18\n- Profit target: 0.165215\n- Stop loss: 0.192755\n- Invalidation condition: If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle\n- Current price is below entry, profit target is 0.165215, which is close. Prices: 0.168, 0.167, ... 0.168625 – no close above 0.195. RSI (7 period): 56.716, not extremely high. Should hold.\n\nBNB:\n- Current price: 994.485\n- Entry price: 990.91\n- Profit target: 1088.135\n- Stop loss: 939.755\n- Invalidation condition: If RSI(7) falls below 40\n- Current RSI (7 period): 64.796, well above 40. Price is above entry. Should hold.\n\nNone of the invalidation conditions are triggered. All positions are performing within expectations, so I should hold all.\n\nNow, for new entries: I have available cash of 2017.84. But I'm already in multiple positions, and the instructions say not to pyramid or size increases. I should only consider new entries if I see a strong opportunity, but since I'm already in all major coins, and no clear new signals, I probably shouldn't enter any new trades.\n\nLook at the market data for potential new alpha:\n\n- BTC: Price rising, RSI at 66.546, MACD improving, but I'm already long BTC, and it's in loss but recovering. No need to add.\n\n- ETH: Similar, already long.\n\n- SOL: Already long.\n\n- XRP: Already long.\n\n- BNB: Already long.\n\n- DOGE: I'm short, and price is near profit target. But since I'm short, and it's doing well, no need to change.\n\nNo coin is flat for me to enter a new position. I'm already in all six coins.\n\nAvailable cash is 2017.84, which is part of the account value, but since I'm fully positioned, I should just hold.\n\nThe instruction: \"For any coin you manage or want to enter, choose exactly one action\" – I'm managing all, so for each, output hold.\n\nAlso, for hold, I need to output the JSON with current quantity, profit target, stop loss, etc., as per the positions.\n\nIn the hold JSON, I need to include confidence and risk_usd, which are from the position data.\n\nNow, for each coin, I output a JSON object with signal 'hold', and the details.\n\nLet me list the quantities and other details from the positions:\n\n- ETH: quantity 5.98, profit_target 3947.075, stop_loss 3408.8375, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.85, risk_usd 1075.578\n\n- SOL: quantity 21.17, profit_target 185.137, stop_loss 159.889, invalidation_condition \"If price closes below 159 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 178.1325\n\n- XRP: quantity 4663.0, profit_target 2.46767, stop_loss 2.29139, invalidation_condition \"If RSI(7) falls below 45\", leverage 20, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 274.642\n\n- BTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\n- DOGE: I'm short, so quantity is negative: -100230.0, profit_target 0.165215, stop_loss 0.192755, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 920.034\n\n- BNB: quantity 7.4, profit_target 1088.135, stop_loss 939.755, invalidation_condition \"If RSI(7) falls below 40\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 366.189\n\nFor hold, the JSON requires all these fields.\n\nI need to output one JSON object per coin, with the trade_signal_args.\n\nSince no changes, all are hold.\n\nFinally, output in the specified format.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "My current positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB are all holding steady as their invalidation conditions have not been met and market indicators remain favorable or are recovering. I'm sticking with my existing trades as no clear new alpha opportunities have emerged, and I've already captured gains on my short DOGE position and see recovery potential in my long BTC position."

Confidence 0.7, risk_usd 366.189, leverage 10.\n\nNow, I need to decide for each coin whether to hold or close the position. I should only close if the invalidation condition is triggered or if my thesis has changed significantly.\n\nLet's assess each coin based on current data:\n\n**BTC:**\n\n- Current price: 107288.0\n\n- EMA20: 107210.447, price is slightly above EMA20.\n\n- MACD: 251.861, decreasing from previous (last few values: 274.48, 300.376, etc.), suggesting momentum might be slowing.\n\n- RSI(7): 49.089, neutral.\n\n- Longer-term: 4-hour MACD negative and declining, RSI(14) 29.335, oversold.\n\n- My position is slightly negative, but invalidation is if price closes below 105000. Current price is above that, so no invalidation yet. Stop loss is at 102026.675, which is far away. I should hold unless invalidated.\n\n**ETH:**\n\n- Current price: 3655.95\n\n- EMA20: 3650.957, price just above EMA20.\n\n- MACD: 12.627, decreasing but still positive.\n\n- RSI(7): 46.458, neutral to slightly bearish.\n\n- Longer-term: 4-hour MACD negative, RSI(14) 25.93, oversold.\n\n- My position is in profit. Invalidation is if price closes below 3400. Current price is well above that. Stop loss at 3408.8375. No reason to close.\n\n**SOL:**\n\n- Current price: 169.235\n\n- EMA20: 169.451, price slightly below EMA20.\n\n- MACD: 0.323, positive but small.\n\n- RSI(7): 40.441, bearish.\n\n- Longer-term: 4-hour MACD negative, RSI(14) 23.905, oversold.\n\n- Position is slightly profitable. Invalidation is if price closes below 159. Current price is above, so hold.\n\n**BNB:**\n\n- Current price: 1002.55\n\n- EMA20: 1003.208, price slightly below EMA20.\n\n- MACD: 2.815, positive.\n\n- RSI(7): 38.062, bearish.\n\n- Invalidation condition is if RSI(7) falls below 40. Current RSI(7) is 38.062, which is below 40. That means the invalidation condition is triggered.\n\n- RSI(7) is 38.062, which is below 40, so according to my exit plan, I should close the position.\n\n**DOGE:**\n\n- Current price: 0.17067\n\n- EMA20: 0.17, very close.\n\n- MACD: 0.001, minimal.\n\n- RSI(7): 51.842, neutral.\n\n- Longer-term: 4-hour MACD negative, RSI(14) 24.547, oversold.\n\n- Position is short and profitable. Invalidation is if price closes above 0.195. Current price is below, so hold.\n\nFor BNB, invalidation condition is met (RSI(7) < 40), so I need to close that position.\n\nFor others, no invalidation, so hold.\n\nNow, any new trades? I have available cash of 2701.96. But I'm already in multiple positions, and I should avoid over-trading. Also, the market seems bearish in longer-term for most coins based on 4-hour data.\n\nLook at signals:\n\n- BTC: MACD decreasing, RSI neutral, but oversold in 4-hour. Not a strong signal.\n\n- ETH: Similar.\n\n- SOL: Weak.\n\n- BNB: I'm closing due to invalidation.\n\n- XRP: Not in position. Current price 2.3747, EMA20 2.375, almost equal. MACD 0.004, small. RSI(7) 45.43, neutral. 4-hour MACD negative, RSI(14) 27.683, oversold. No clear signal.\n\n- DOGE: Already short, holding.\n\nNo compelling new opportunities. Available cash is 2701.96, but since I'm closing BNB, I'll have more cash, but I shouldn't enter new trades just because.\n\nFor BNB closing, I need to output close_position with current quantity.\n\nAlso, for holding positions, I need to output hold with all details.\n\nOutput should be JSON for each coin I act on or hold.\n\nCoins: ETH, SOL, BTC, DOGE, BNB (to close), and XRP not in position, no action.\n\nFor XRP, no action, so I don't output anything for XRP.\n\nOnly output for coins where I have a position or am entering/exiting.\n\nSo for ETH, SOL, BTC, DOGE: hold\n\nFor BNB: close_position\n\nNow, for hold, I need to provide the same details: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd. These are from the current positions.\n\nSimilarly for close, same thing.\n\nIn the output, for hold and close, I must include all these fields.\n\nAlso, for close, I need a justification.\n\nJustification for closing BNB: RSI(7) has fallen below 40, triggering the invalidation condition.\n\nFor hold, no justification needed in the JSON for hold signal, only for close or enter.\n\nLooking back at the output format:\n\nFor hold: JSON has \"justification\" field? No, in the example for hold, it doesn't have \"justification\", only for entry and close.\n\nCheck:\n\nFor Entry/Exit: has \"justification\"\n\nFor Close: has \"justification\"\n\nFor Hold: does not have \"justification\" in the JSON example.\n\nIn the hold example:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo \"justification\" key for hold.\n\nFor close:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"justification\": \"<1–2 sentences>\",\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nHas \"justification\".\n\nSo for hold, I don't need to provide justification, just the other fields.\n\nNow, for each coin, I need to output the JSON.\n\nFirst, for BNB, close_position.\n\nQuantity: 7.4 (from current position)\n\nProfit_target: 1088.135 (from exit_plan)\n\nStop_loss: 939.755 (from exit_plan)\n\nInvalidation_condition: \"If RSI(7) falls below 40\" – but since it's triggered, I'm closing, but I should keep the same condition or state it? The condition is already met, but in the output, I need to provide the invalidation_condition string as per the plan.\n\nIn the close JSON, I need to include invalidation_condition, which is from the exit plan.\n\nLeverage: 10\n\nConfidence: 0.7 (from current)\n\nRisk_usd: 366.189 (from current)\n\nJustification: \"RSI(7) has fallen below 40, triggering the invalidation condition for the BNB long position.\"\n\nFor other coins, hold with their respective details.\n\nETH: quantity 5.98, profit_target 3947.075, stop_loss 3408.8375, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.85, risk_usd 1075.578\n\nSOL: quantity 21.17, profit_target 185.137, stop_loss 159.889, invalidation_condition \"If price closes below 159 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 178.1325\n\nBTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity -100230.0, profit_target 0.165215, stop_loss 0.192755, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 920.034\n\nNote: for DOGE, quantity is negative because it's a short position, but in the output, it should be the full current size, which is negative.\n\nIn the JSON, quantity is a float, and for short, it's negative, which is fine.\n\nNow, output JSON for each coin.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON is valid.\n\nAlso, no new trades, so only these.\n\nFinally, compile the JSON output{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 5.98,\n      \"profit_target\": 3947.075,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3408.8375,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.85,\n      \"risk_usd\": 1075.578\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 21.17,\n      \"profit_target\": 185.137,\n      \"stop_loss\": 159.889,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If price closes below 159 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 178.1325\n    }\n  },\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.12,\n      \"profit_target\": 118136.15,\n      \"stop_loss\": 102026.675,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"risk_usd\": 619.2345\n    }\n  },\n  \"DOGE\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"DOGE\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": -100230.0,\n      \"profit_target\": 0.165215,\n      \"stop_loss\": 0.192755,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 920.034\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"justification\": \"RSI(7) has fallen below 40, triggering the invalidation condition for the BNB long position.\",\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"close_position\",\n      \"quantity\": 7.4,\n      \"profit_target\": 1088.135,\n      \"stop_loss\": 939.755,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"If RSI(7) falls below 40\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"risk_usd\": 366.189\n    }\n  }\n}"

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, BTC, and DOGE.\n\n- ETH: Long position, quantity 5.98, entry price 3595.2, current price 3658.65, unrealized profit of 379.43. Exit plan has profit target at 3947.075, stop loss at 3408.8375, and invalidation condition: price closes below 3400 on 3-minute candle. Confidence 0.85.\n\n- SOL: Long position, quantity 21.17, entry price 168.13, current price 169.125, unrealized profit of 21.06. Profit target 185.137, stop loss 159.889, invalidation: price closes below 159 on 3-minute candle. Confidence 0.65.\n\n- BTC: Long position, quantity 0.12, entry price 107343.0, current price 107233.0, unrealized loss of 13.2. Profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation: price closes below 105000 on 3-minute candle. Confidence 0.75.\n\n- DOGE: Short position, quantity -100230.0, entry price 0.18, current price 0.170435, unrealized profit of 1299.18. Profit target 0.165215, stop loss 0.192755, invalidation: price closes above 0.195 on 3-minute candle. Confidence 0.7.\n\nNow, I need to decide for each coin whether to hold or close the position based on the current market data and my exit plans. I must not close unless the invalidation condition is triggered or there's a specific reason, but the exit plan should be managed by the stop and profit targets. I'm only to hold or close if invalidated.\n\nCheck each position:\n\n- ETH: Current price 3658.65, above stop loss (3408.8375). Invalidation condition is price below 3400, which hasn't happened. Price is rising slightly in the last few minutes (from 3655.8 to 3658.65). EMA20 is 3652.594, close to price. MACD is positive but decreasing. RSI 7 is 55.014, not overbought. No reason to close, so I should hold.\n\n- SOL: Current price 169.125, stop loss is 159.889, which is far below. Invalidation is price below 159, current is above. Price has been fluctuating around 169. EMA20 is 169.388, very close. MACD is positive but small. RSI 7 is 39.227, a bit low, but not critical. Funding is negative, which is good for shorts, but I'm long, so it might be a cost, but not a reason to close yet. I should hold.\n\n- BTC: Current price 107233.0, stop loss is 102026.675, still above. Invalidation is price below 105000, current is above. Price has been declining from highs, EMA20 is 107212.77, close. MACD is positive but decreasing, RSI 7 is 45.485, neutral. Funding is positive but small. I'm in a small loss, but stop is not hit. Hold.\n\n- DOGE: Short position, current price 0.170435, profit target is 0.165215, which is below, stop loss is 0.192755, above. Invalidation is price above 0.195, which is far. Price has been stable around 0.171, now 0.170435, EMA20 is 0.17, so price is below EMA, which is good for short. RSI 7 is 46.455, not oversold. Funding is negative, which benefits shorts. Unrealized profit is good. Hold.\n\nNo invalidation conditions are triggered for any position. So, for all existing positions, I should output \"hold\".\n\nNow, for new entries, I need to check if there are any opportunities. I'm already in four positions, and I might not have enough available cash or might be overexposed. Available cash is 3516.11, and total account value is 10742.82. The notional values of positions are: ETH 21878.73, SOL 3580.38, BTC 12867.96, DOGE 17082.7. Sum of notional is about 21878.73 + 3580.38 = 25459.11, +12867.96 = 38327.07, +17082.7 = 55409.77. Account value is 10742.82, so total margin used is not directly given, but from entry prices and quantities, I can infer.\n\nMargin for each position: notional / leverage.\n\nETH: notional 21878.73, leverage 10, so margin ≈ 2187.873\n\nSOL: notional 3580.38, leverage 10, margin ≈ 358.038\n\nBTC: notional 12867.96, leverage 10, margin ≈ 1286.796\n\nDOGE: notional 17082.7, leverage 10, margin ≈ 1708.27\n\nTotal margin used: 2187.873 + 358.038 = 2545.911, +1286.796 = 3832.707, +1708.27 = 5540.977\n\nAvailable cash is 3516.11, so total account value should be margin used + available cash ≈ 5540.977 + 3516.11 = 9057.087, but the account value is given as 10742.82, which is higher, probably due to unrealized PnL. Unrealized PnL sum: ETH +379.43, SOL +21.06, BTC -13.2, DOGE +1299.18, total 379.43 + 21.06 = 400.49, -13.2 = 387.29, +1299.18 = 1686.47. So equity = margin used + unrealized PnL ≈ 5540.977 + 1686.47 = 7227.447, but account value is 10742.82, discrepancy. Perhaps the notional includes leverage, and margin is separate.\n\nFrom account info, available cash is 3516.11, and positions have unrealized PnL, so total equity is cash + market value of positions.\n\nBetter to use the given account value.\n\nFor new entries, I need to see if I want to enter any other coins. Tradable coins are ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. I'm already in ETH, SOL, BTC, DOGE, so only XRP and BNB are not held.\n\nCheck XRP and BNB for potential entries.\n\nFirst, XRP:\n\nCurrent price: 2.37065\n\nEMA20: 2.374, very close, price slightly below.\n\nMACD: 0.001, almost zero, signaling no strong momentum.\n\nRSI 7: 39.314, below 40, indicating oversold.\n\nRSI 14: 51.062, neutral.\n\nLonger-term: 4h EMA20 at 2.475 vs 50 at 2.508, both above current price, so downtrend.\n\nMACD 4h: negative and decreasing.\n\nVolume: current 12248 vs avg 7222744, very low volume.\n\nFunding rate: negative, -1.80618e-05, which is good for shorts, but RSI is oversold, might be due for a bounce.\n\nNot a strong signal. Confidence low.\n\nBNB:\n\nCurrent price: 1002.25\n\nEMA20: 1002.858, price slightly below.\n\nMACD: 1.499, positive but small.\n\nRSI 7: 39.005, oversold.\n\nRSI 14: 52.824, neutral.\n\nLonger-term: 4h EMA20 at 1065.097 vs 50 at 1088.243, both above, downtrend.\n\nMACD 4h: negative and decreasing.\n\nVolume: current 440.897 vs avg 8543.901, low volume.\n\nFunding rate: negative, -4.56271e-05, good for shorts.\n\nSimilar to XRP, oversold but in downtrend.\n\nNot confident for entry.\n\nFor the coins I'm in, no reason to close.\n\nI should not enter new positions because I'm already in four, and available cash might not be sufficient for a meaningful position after considering minimum margin.\n\nMinimum margin is 5% of available cash, which is 0.05 * 3516.11 ≈ 175.8055 USD.\n\nFor example, if I enter BNB with leverage 10 (max for BNB is 10x), notional would be margin * leverage.\n\nBut confidence is low, so I shouldn't enter.\n\nSimilarly for XRP.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid over-trading.\n\nSo, for this invocation, I should only output hold for the existing positions.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I act on, which are the ones I have positions in.\n\nFor hold, the JSON should include all the fields: coin, signal, quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI need to use the current values from the positions.\n\nFrom the account info, for each position, I have:\n\nETH: quantity 5.98, profit_target 3947.075, stop_loss 3408.8375, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.85, risk_usd 1075.578\n\nSOL: quantity 21.17, profit_target 185.137, stop_loss 159.889, invalidation \"If price closes below 159 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 178.1325\n\nBTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity -100230.0, profit_target 0.165215, stop_loss 0.192755, invalidation \"If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 920.034\n\nI need to output these in the hold JSON.\n\nThe signal is \"hold\", and I must include justification for hold? No, for hold, the JSON doesn't require justification, only for entry and close.\n\nLook back at the instructions:\n\nFor hold: \n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo justification field for hold.\n\nFor entry and close, there is justification.\n\nSo for hold, I don't need to add justification.\n\nSimilarly, for the existing positions, I should output hold with the current parameters.\n\nNow, for the output, I need a JSON object for each coin that I have a position in, with signal \"hold\".\n\nAlso, I'm not entering any new trades, so no entry signals.\n\nFinally, output the JSON.",
    "cot_trace_summary": "I'm holding my positions in ETH, SOL, BTC, and DOGE as no invalidation conditions were met, and the market action suggests continued momentum for most. My strong ETH long, supported by an 85% confidence and a solid unrealized profit, remains my primary focus, while my short on DOGE continues to profit nicely from the price staying below its entry."

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. I must decide for each coin whether to hold or close, based on their current state and invalidation conditions.\n\nLooking at ETH: \n- Current price: 3641.9, entry price: 3595.2, so up about 46.7 USD.\n- Profit target: 3947.075, which is about 8.5% above entry, but current is still below that.\n- Stop loss: 3408.8375, which is below current price.\n- Invalidation condition: If price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is above that.\n- RSI is low at 31.213, but that might indicate oversold, but since I'm long, lower RSI could be good for continuation or mean reversion? I need to see the trend.\n- EMA20 is 3650.435, current price is slightly below, so not bullish short-term, but not broken down.\n- MACD is positive but decreasing.\n- Longer-term context shows price below EMAs, RSI low.\n- Unrealized PnL is positive, so I should hold unless invalidation triggers.\n- Invalidation hasn't triggered, so I should hold ETH.\n\nFor SOL:\n- Current price: 168.565, entry: 168.13, almost flat.\n- Profit target: 185.137, stop loss: 159.889.\n- Invalidation: If price closes below 159 on a 3-minute candle. Current is way above.\n- RSI 35.042, low, could be oversold.\n- EMA20: 169.07, price below, slight bearish bias.\n- MACD negative and decreasing.\n- Longer-term bearish.\n- PnL small positive, no invalidation, so hold.\n\nFor BTC:\n- Current price: 107020.5, entry: 107343.0, down about 322.5 USD.\n- Profit target: 118136.15, high above.\n- Stop loss: 102026.675, which is below current.\n- Invalidation: If price closes below 105000. Current is above.\n- RSI 35.003, low.\n- EMA20: 107204.262, price below, bearish.\n- MACD positive but decreasing.\n- Longer-term bearish with RSI low.\n- PnL negative, but not hit stop or invalidation. Invalidation is at 105000, current is 107020, so still above. Should hold.\n\nFor DOGE:\n- I'm short DOGE. Quantity negative, entry 0.18, current 0.169605, so profit.\n- Profit target: 0.165215, which is below current, so not hit yet.\n- Stop loss: 0.192755, above current.\n- Invalidation: If price closes above 0.195. Current is 0.1696, way below.\n- RSI 31.417, low, which for a short position, low RSI might indicate oversold and potential bounce, but since I'm short, it could be good, but need to be cautious.\n- EMA20: 0.17, price below, bearish.\n- MACD flat.\n- Longer-term bearish.\n- PnL positive, no invalidation, so hold.\n\nFor BNB:\n- Current price: 997.06, entry: 997.36, almost flat.\n- Profit target: 1100.0, high above.\n- Stop loss: 948.615, below.\n- Invalidation: If price closes below 900. Current is 997, above.\n- RSI 27.074, very low, oversold.\n- EMA20: 1000.683, price below, bearish.\n- MACD negative.\n- Longer-term bearish.\n- PnL small negative, no invalidation, so hold.\n\nNow, I need to check if I should enter any new positions. I'm already in 5 positions, and available cash is 2462.26. But the instructions say I can enter new trades if justified, but also to avoid over-trading. I should only enter if there's a strong opportunity.\n\nLook at the coins: All seem to be in downtrends or weak. RSI is low for most, which might indicate oversold conditions, but momentum is bearish.\n\nCheck each coin for potential entries.\n\nBTC: Price below EMA20, RSI low, MACD decreasing. Not a strong buy signal. Funding rate positive but small. Open interest decreasing slightly? Latest 29756.92 vs avg 29851.19, so slightly down, not significant.\n\nETH: Similar, price below EMA20, RSI low, MACD decreasing. Funding small positive.\n\nSOL: Price below EMA20, RSI low, MACD negative, funding negative. Negative funding might be good for shorts, but I'm already long SOL, so conflicting. But for new entry, perhaps short? But RSI low, so maybe not best to short here.\n\nBNB: Very low RSI, price below EMA20, MACD negative, funding negative. Could be oversold, but trend down.\n\nXRP: Not in any position. Current price 2.35625, EMA20 2.367, price below. RSI 28.448, low. MACD -0.004, slightly negative. Funding negative. Open interest high. Longer-term bearish. Might be oversold, but no clear reversal signal.\n\nDOGE: I'm already short, so not entering again.\n\nAvailable cash is 2462.26, which is about 23% of account value (10716.84), so I have some cash, but I'm already heavily invested in multiple positions. Perhaps I should not enter new trades to avoid over-concentration.\n\nThe instructions say: \"avoid over-trading by discovering alpha.\" And \"only enter if you expect the move to exceed all trading costs by a significant amount.\"\n\nNone of the coins show strong reversal or breakout signals. All are in downtrends with low RSI, but no confirmation of bounce.\n\nPerhaps I should just hold all existing positions since none have hit invalidation or stop loss.\n\nFor the output, I need to provide JSON for each coin I act on, which includes all positions I'm in, with 'hold' signal, and if I enter new, but I don't think I should enter any new ones.\n\nConfirm the positions: ETH, SOL, BTC, DOGE, BNB are all open.\n\nFor each, I need to output the JSON with 'hold' signal, and include all the details: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nIn the 'hold' case, I don't need justification, according to the JSON example for hold.\n\nLooking back:\n\nFor hold:\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nI need to provide the current values from the position. The exit_plan has profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and I have confidence and risk_usd from the position data.\n\nIn the account info, for each position, it has 'exit_plan' which includes profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and also confidence and risk_usd separately.\n\nFor example, for ETH: \n- quantity: 5.98\n- profit_target: 3947.075\n- stop_loss: 3408.8375\n- invalidation_condition: 'If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle'\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.85\n- risk_usd: 1075.578\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI should use these values in the output.\n\nNow, for DOGE, I'm short, so the profit_target and stop_loss might be set differently, but in the data, profit_target is 0.165215, which is below entry since short, and stop_loss is 0.192755 above.\n\nIn the JSON, for hold, I just need to report the current plan.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that for hold, I'm not changing anything, just maintaining.\n\nNow, is there any coin where invalidation is close? For example, BTC invalidation is at 105000, current is 107020, so about 2020 away, which with ATR, 3-period ATR is 1253.667, so not immediately threatened.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps I should consider closing if RSI is very low and might bounce, but since I'm long in most, low RSI could be good for bounce, but my invalidation is not triggered.\n\nFor DOGE short, low RSI might indicate oversold, so potential for bounce, which is bad for my short, but invalidation is at 0.195, which is far.\n\nCurrent price 0.1696, invalidation 0.195, so about 15% away, so not close.\n\nI think no action needed, just hold all.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"For any coin you manage or want to enter, choose exactly one action\" and I must output for each coin I act on, but since I'm holding, I need to output for all coins I have positions in.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object for each coin that I either act on or have a position in with hold.\n\nLooking at the example, it says: \"you should return a json object for each coin that you either act on (i.e. buy_to_enter, sell_to_enter, close_position), OR, for existing positions, you should return a json object for each coin with the signal 'hold'.\"\n\nSo I need to output for ETH, SOL, BTC, DOGE, BNB with 'hold'.\n\nI don't have any new entries, so no 'buy_to_enter' or 'sell_to_enter'.\n\nNow, for the JSON, I need to structure it properly.\n\nThe output should be a single JSON object with keys for each coin, like {\"ETH\": {...}, \"SOL\": {...}, etc.}\n\nAnd for each, the inner object has \"trade_signal_args\" with the details.\n\nAlso, for hold, no justification is needed in the JSON, according to the example.\n\nIn the hold example, there is no \"justification\" field, but in entry and close, there is.\n\nCheck:\n\nFor entry/exit: has \"justification\"\n\nFor close: has \"justification\"\n\nFor hold: no \"justification\" in the example.\n\nIn the hold JSON example: \n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNo \"justification\" key.\n\nWhereas for entry and close, it has \"justification\".\n\nSo for hold, I don't need to provide justification.\n\nNow, for the values, I take them from the current position data.\n\nList them out:\n\nETH:\n- coin: \"ETH\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 5.98\n- profit_target: 3947.075\n- stop_loss: 3408.8375\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.85\n- risk_usd: 1075.578\n\nSOL:\n- coin: \"SOL\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 21.17\n- profit_target: 185.137\n- stop_loss: 159.889\n- invalidation_condition: \"If price closes below 159 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.65\n- risk_usd: 178.1325\n\nBTC:\n- coin: \"BTC\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 0.12\n- profit_target: 118136.15\n- stop_loss: 102026.675\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.75\n- risk_usd: 619.2345\n\nDOGE:\n- coin: \"DOGE\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: -100230.0  (since short, negative)\n- profit_target: 0.165215\n- stop_loss: 0.192755\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.7\n- risk_usd: 920.034\n\nBNB:\n- coin: \"BNB\"\n- signal: \"hold\"\n- quantity: 10.56\n- profit_target: 1100.0\n- stop_loss: 948.615\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 900 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.75\n- risk_usd: 527.4165\n\nNow, I need to output this as a JSON object.\n\nAlso, note that for DOGE, quantity is negative, which is fine for short.\n\nNow, is there any coin I should close? Perhaps if invalidation is imminent, but it's not.\n\nOr if there's a better opportunity, but I don't see any.\n\nI should not enter new trades since I'm already in multiple positions and cash is limited.\n\nAvailable cash is 2462.26, and minimum margin is 5% of available cash, which is about 123.113, so I could enter small positions, but with low confidence, it's not worth it.\n\nAll coins are in similar bearish trends, so no strong alpha.\n\nThus, I'll hold all positions.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to create a JSON with keys for each coin.\n\nThe output should be a single JSON object, so I'll combine them.\n\nFinally, output only JSON, no prose.",

Exit plan: profit target 3947.075, stop loss 3408.8375, invalidation condition is if price closes below 3400 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is above stop loss and not near invalidation. RSI is low at 20.662, but MACD is negative. I should hold unless invalidation triggers.\n\n- **SOL**: Long position, quantity 21.17, entry price 168.13, current price 166.955, unrealized PnL -24.87. Exit plan: profit target 185.137, stop loss 159.889, invalidation if price closes below 159 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is above stop loss, RSI is very low at 11.571, which might indicate oversold, but invalidation not triggered. Hold.\n\n- **XRP**: Long position, quantity 1581.0, entry price 2.34, current price 2.33365, unrealized PnL -3.01. Exit plan: profit target 2.6844, stop loss 2.2176, invalidation if price closes below 2.200 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is above stop loss, RSI low at 15.318, but not invalidated. Hold.\n\n- **BTC**: Long position, quantity 0.12, entry price 107343.0, current price 106511.5, unrealized PnL -99.78. Exit plan: profit target 118136.15, stop loss 102026.675, invalidation if price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is 106511.5, which is above 105000, so invalidation not triggered.

Exit plan: profit target 0.165215, stop loss 0.192755, invalidation if price closes above 0.195 on a 3-minute candle. Current price is 0.16856, which is below stop loss and profit target is close (0.165215 vs 0.16856). Profit target might be hit soon. Invalidation not triggered.
