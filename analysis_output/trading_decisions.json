RSI(7) = 39, showing oversold conditions. MACD negative at -31.878, showing bearish momentum.

The widespread oversold RSI readings suggest potential for a short-term bounce or consolidation. Despite the negative indicators, the critical invalidation level for my positions remains intact, providing a buffer against immediate downside risk.\n\nThe portfolio is currently experiencing a -15.46% return, which is concerning but not yet at a critical point. With substantial available cash of $5,265.31, I have flexibility to manage these positions or potentially add new opportunities if market conditions shift.\n\nMy current strategy focuses on patience and risk management. I'll maintain existing positions in XRP and DOGE, avoiding additional entries until clearer reversal signals emerge.

So no new entries possible.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin with the signal 'hold', including all the required fields: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI have the current positions from the account info, so I can use those values.\n\nFor each coin, I need to output the current quantity, which is given, and the exit plan details.\n\nLet me list out the values for each:\n\n- ETH: quantity 3.11, profit_target 4005.042, stop_loss 3682.104, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 334.24\n\n- SOL: quantity 81.81, profit_target 201.081, stop_loss 176.713, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 15, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 499.504\n\n- XRP: quantity 6837.0, profit_target 2.453, stop_loss 2.2778, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 20, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 400\n\n- BTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\n- DOGE: quantity 27858.0, profit_target 0.212275, stop_loss 0.175355, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 257.13\n\n- BNB: quantity 8.23, profit_target 1158.38, stop_loss 1000.39, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 950 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 435.0\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin with signal 'hold'. The JSON structure should be as per the example for hold.\n\nAlso, for hold, I don't need a justification, as per the example: for hold, the trade_signal_args doesn't include justification, but looking back at the instruction, for hold, it says: \"Supply a json object for each existing position\" and the example includes all fields but no justification. Let me check.\n\nIn the hold example:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIt doesn't mention justification for hold. Similarly, for close, it has justification, but for hold, it might not be required. But in the entry/exit, it has justification. To be safe, I should include justification only for actions that change position, but for hold, it's not specified. Looking at the instruction: \"For Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position\" and the example doesn't have justification. So I won't include it for hold.\n\nNow, I need to output this for all coins I have positions in.\n\nSince I'm not closing or entering any, I'll output hold for all.\n\nFinally, the output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, the overall output should be a dictionary with keys like \"ETH\", \"SOL\", etc., each containing the trade_signal_args.\n\nI need to make sure the numbers are accurate and use the current values.\n\nAlso, confidence and risk_usd are from the entry, but I should keep them as is since they are part of the position.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to format it correctly.",

So no new entries possible.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin with the signal 'hold', including all the required fields: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI have the current positions from the account info, so I can use those values.\n\nFor each coin, I need to output the current quantity, which is given, and the exit plan details.\n\nLet me list out the values for each:\n\n- ETH: quantity 3.11, profit_target 4005.042, stop_loss 3682.104, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 334.24\n\n- SOL: quantity 81.81, profit_target 201.081, stop_loss 176.713, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 15, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 499.504\n\n- XRP: quantity 6837.0, profit_target 2.453, stop_loss 2.2778, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 20, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 400\n\n- BTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\n- DOGE: quantity 27858.0, profit_target 0.212275, stop_loss 0.175355, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 257.13\n\n- BNB: quantity 8.23, profit_target 1158.38, stop_loss 1000.39, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 950 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 435.0\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin with signal 'hold'. The JSON structure should be as per the example for hold.\n\nAlso, for hold, I don't need a justification, as per the example: for hold, the trade_signal_args doesn't include justification, but looking back at the instruction, for hold, it says: \"Supply a json object for each existing position\" and the example includes all fields but no justification. Let me check.\n\nIn the hold example:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIt doesn't mention justification for hold. Similarly, for close, it has justification, but for hold, it might not be required. But in the entry/exit, it has justification. To be safe, I should include justification only for actions that change position, but for hold, it's not specified. Looking at the instruction: \"For Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position\" and the example doesn't have justification. So I won't include it for hold.\n\nNow, I need to output this for all coins I have positions in.\n\nSince I'm not closing or entering any, I'll output hold for all.\n\nFinally, the output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, the overall output should be a dictionary with keys like \"ETH\", \"SOL\", etc., each containing the trade_signal_args.\n\nI need to make sure the numbers are accurate and use the current values.\n\nAlso, confidence and risk_usd are from the entry, but I should keep them as is since they are part of the position.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to format it correctly.",

So no new entries possible.\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin with the signal 'hold', including all the required fields: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.\n\nI have the current positions from the account info, so I can use those values.\n\nFor each coin, I need to output the current quantity, which is given, and the exit plan details.\n\nLet me list out the values for each:\n\n- ETH: quantity 3.11, profit_target 4005.042, stop_loss 3682.104, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 334.24\n\n- SOL: quantity 81.81, profit_target 201.081, stop_loss 176.713, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 15, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 499.504\n\n- XRP: quantity 6837.0, profit_target 2.453, stop_loss 2.2778, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 20, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 400\n\n- BTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\n- DOGE: quantity 27858.0, profit_target 0.212275, stop_loss 0.175355, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 257.13\n\n- BNB: quantity 8.23, profit_target 1158.38, stop_loss 1000.39, invalidation_condition \"If the price closes below 950 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 435.0\n\nI need to output JSON for each coin with signal 'hold'. The JSON structure should be as per the example for hold.\n\nAlso, for hold, I don't need a justification, as per the example: for hold, the trade_signal_args doesn't include justification, but looking back at the instruction, for hold, it says: \"Supply a json object for each existing position\" and the example includes all fields but no justification. Let me check.\n\nIn the hold example:\n\n{\n  \"COIN\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"COIN\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": <full current size>,\n      \"profit_target\": <float>,\n      \"stop_loss\": <float>,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"<string>\",\n      \"leverage\": <int 5–40>,\n      \"confidence\": <0–1>,   \n      \"risk_usd\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIt doesn't mention justification for hold. Similarly, for close, it has justification, but for hold, it might not be required. But in the entry/exit, it has justification. To be safe, I should include justification only for actions that change position, but for hold, it's not specified. Looking at the instruction: \"For Hold (hold). Supply a json object for each existing position\" and the example doesn't have justification. So I won't include it for hold.\n\nNow, I need to output this for all coins I have positions in.\n\nSince I'm not closing or entering any, I'll output hold for all.\n\nFinally, the output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, the overall output should be a dictionary with keys like \"ETH\", \"SOL\", etc., each containing the trade_signal_args.\n\nI need to make sure the numbers are accurate and use the current values.\n\nAlso, confidence and risk_usd are from the entry, but I should keep them as is since they are part of the position.\n\nNow, for the JSON output, I need to format it correctly.",

    "cot_trace": "First, I need to check my existing positions' exit plans and justifications. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, and DOGE. For each, I need to decide whether to hold or close based on the invalidation conditions and current market data.\n\nLet's review each position:\n\n1. **ETH**: \n   - Current price: 3875.75, entry price: 3794.9, unrealized PnL: +251.44\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 4005.042, stop loss at 3682.104, invalidation condition: price closes below 3700 on 3-min candle.\n   - Current RSI(7) is 75.181, which is high but not extremely overbought. EMA20 is 3853.367, and price is above it. MACD is positive at 5.173. Funding is low. No invalidation trigger yet. I should hold.\n\n2. **SOL**:\n   - Current price: 191.515, entry price: 182.8, unrealized PnL: +712.97\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 201.081, stop loss at 176.713, invalidation: price closes below 175 on 3-min candle.\n   - RSI(7) is 72.454, high but not extreme. Price above EMA20 of 190.424. MACD positive at 0.168. Funding low. No invalidation. Hold.\n\n3. **XRP**:\n   - Current price: 2.4154, entry price: 2.34, unrealized PnL: +544.91\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 2.453, stop loss at 2.2778, invalidation: price closes below 2.30 on 3-min candle.\n   - RSI(7) is 70.953, high. Price above EMA20 of 2.405. MACD is flat at 0.003. Funding low. No invalidation. Hold.\n\n4. **BTC**:\n   - Current price: 110092.5, entry price: 107343.0, unrealized PnL: +329.94\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 118136.15, stop loss at 102026.675, invalidation: price closes below 105000 on 3-min candle.\n   - RSI(7) is 74.713, high. Price above EMA20 of 109683.859. MACD positive at 108.683. Funding low. No invalidation. Hold.\n\n5. **DOGE**:\n   - Current price: 0.195725, entry price: 0.18, unrealized PnL: +310.64\n   - Exit plan: profit target at 0.212275, stop loss at 0.175355, invalidation: price closes below 0.180 on 3-min candle.\n   - RSI(7) is 74.551, high. Price above EMA20 of 0.195. MACD flat at 0.0. Funding low. No invalidation. Hold.\n\nAll positions are in profit, and none have hit their invalidation conditions. The market data shows strong upward momentum with high RSI, but since we're not at extreme overbought levels yet and trends are intact, I should hold all positions.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I want to enter any new positions. The only coin I'm not in is BNB. Let's look at BNB data:\n\n- Current price: 1148.6\n- EMA20: 1114.834, price is above it.\n- MACD: 13.816, positive and increasing.\n- RSI(7): 76.403, which is high, indicating overbought, but momentum is strong.\n- Longer-term: EMA20 (1087.993) below EMA50 (1111.367) on 4-hour, but price is above both. ATR is low.\n- Open interest is stable, funding low.\n\nBNB looks bullish, but RSI is high, so there might be a pullback risk. However, the trend is up. I need to assess if there's alpha here.\n\nMy available cash is 6173.91. I should only enter if confident. Confidence table: if I'm confident between 0.70-0.85, margin should be 20-40% of available cash. But BNB RSI is 76.4, which is overbought, so confidence might be lower. Perhaps around 0.65-0.70, so margin 10-20%.\n\nBut I already have five positions, and I should avoid over-diversification. Also, the instructions say \"discover alpha\", but I need to ensure it's worth the trading costs. BNB has moved up a lot recently, so entering now might be chasing.\n\nGiven that I have multiple positions already and BNB is overbought, I might skip entering BNB to avoid over-trading. The goal is to maximize PnL after fees, and entering a new position with high RSI might not be optimal.\n\nI should focus on managing existing positions. No invalidation triggers, so hold all.\n\nFor each coin, I need to output JSON for the action. Since I'm holding, I use the \"hold\" format. I must include all the details: quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd from the existing positions.\n\nI need to output for each coin I have a position in, and for BNB, since I'm not entering, I don't output anything for BNB.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with keys for each coin I'm acting on. Since I'm only holding, it's for ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE.\n\nFor each, the signal is \"hold\", and I need to provide the current quantity and the exit plan details from the account information.\n\nLooking at the account info, each position has exit_plan with profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, and also confidence, risk_usd, leverage.\n\nI should use those values in the output.\n\nFor example, for ETH:\n- quantity: 3.11\n- profit_target: 4005.042\n- stop_loss: 3682.104\n- invalidation_condition: \"If the price closes below 3700 on a 3-minute candle\"\n- leverage: 10\n- confidence: 0.7\n- risk_usd: 334.24\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON is correct.\n\nAlso, for hold, the justification is not required, as per the format: for hold, the trade_signal_args does not include \"justification\". Only for entry and close, justification is required.\n\nIn the hold format example, there is no \"justification\" key. So I should omit it.\n\nNow, for BNB, I'm not entering, so no output.\n\nFinally, output one JSON object with keys for each coin.\n\nSo, the output should be:\n\n{\n  \"ETH\": { ... },\n  \"SOL\": { ... },\n  \"XRP\": { ... },\n  \"BTC\": { ... },\n  \"DOGE\": { ... }\n}\n\nEach with the hold structure.\n\nConfirm the values from account info.\n\nFor SOL: quantity 81.81, profit_target 201.081, stop_loss 176.713, invalidation \"If the price closes below 175 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 15, confidence 0.7, risk_usd 499.504\n\nXRP: quantity 6837.0, profit_target 2.453, stop_loss 2.2778, invalidation \"If the price closes below 2.30 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 20, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 400\n\nBTC: quantity 0.12, profit_target 118136.15, stop_loss 102026.675, invalidation \"If the price closes below 105000 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.75, risk_usd 619.2345\n\nDOGE: quantity 27858.0, profit_target 0.212275, stop_loss 0.175355, invalidation \"If the price closes below 0.180 on a 3-minute candle\", leverage 10, confidence 0.65, risk_usd 257.13\n\nAll look correct.\n\nI think that's it.",

    "cot_trace": "**Execution Summary: Maintaining Position and Market Monitoring**\n\nMy objective here is clear: maximize profits on Hyperliquid, minimize overtrading, and identify profitable alpha. Every three minutes I'm tasked with making smart decisions regarding BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, BNB, and DOGE. My approach is disciplined: I re-evaluate my existing positions, choose a single action (buy, sell, hold, or close) for each coin, and strictly avoid increasing positions or averaging down.\n\nConsidering all these assets, I have six open short positions. Before anything, I'm verifying the 4-hour EMA cross strategy remains valid. My entry plan involves using market price against the 4h. For new entries, I calculate `margin`, `leverage`, `risk_usd`, and `profit_target`. I've set my confidence levels for position sizing to be in line with the margin guidelines. I'm also mindful of the round-trip fees, which are roughly 0.09%, and only take actions when I'm certain to generate sufficient profit to clear the fees.\n\nAfter careful analysis, my current strategy is still intact and no changes are needed. I'm currently short on all six tokens. Intraday charts show some bullish moves, but are not strong enough to challenge the 4h downtrend. My focus is on the 4-hour EMA crosses (20 vs 50 periods). I use them to check the invalidation conditions for my positions. For now, the 20 EMA is below the 50 EMA on each of these tokens, which signals I should stick with short positions. Given these conditions, and since there is no new actionable insight, I will hold each of my current positions, ensuring the continued viability of my trades.\n\nHere is the JSON output, which will be transmitted to the system:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"BTC\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BTC\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 0.08,\n      \"profit_target\": 105186.06,\n      \"stop_loss\": 111759.72,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"4-hour 20-period EMA crosses above the 50-period EMA.\",\n      \"leverage\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 168.22\n    }\n  },\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"ETH\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 1.18,\n      \"profit_target\": 3538.185,\n      \"stop_loss\": 3988.516,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"The 4-hour 20-period EMA crosses back above the 50-period EMA.\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 151.71\n    }\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"SOL\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 18.44,\n      \"profit_target\": 176.479,\n      \"stop_loss\": 195.388,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"The 4-hour 20-period EMA crosses back above the 50-period EMA.\",\n      \"leverage\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 0.6,\n      \"risk_usd\": 116.43\n    }\n  },\n  \"BNB\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"BNB\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 3.75,\n      \"profit_target\": 1019.22,\n      \"stop_loss\": 1152.16,\n      \"invalidation_condition\": \"The 4-hour 20-period EMA crosses back above the 50-period EMA.\",\n      \"leverage\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 0.65,\n      \"risk_usd\": 166.21\n    }\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"trade_signal_args\": {\n      \"coin\": \"XRP\",\n      \"signal\": \"hold\",\n      \"quantity\": 965.0",

    "cot_trace": "**Hyperliquid Strategy Execution**\n\nAlright, let's get down to business. I'm a systematic trader on Hyperliquid, aiming to squeeze out profits while keeping a lid on over-trading. Every three minutes, I'm given market data and my account info, and it's time to act.\n\n**My Approach:** I stick to a clear plan. First, I review my open positions, checking their exit strategies and reasons. Then, for each coin, it's one action: buy to enter, sell to enter, hold, or close. No pyramiding allowed—I'm sizing correctly from the start.\n\n**Costs are Key:** Fees, slippage, funding... they all eat into my gains. I'm only entering a trade if I'm pretty sure the expected move will crush those costs. I need a solid reason to open a position.\n\n**Sizing it Right:** I calculate margin, leverage, risk, profit targets, and invalidation conditions for each new trade. My confidence level dictates my margin. If I'm feeling good, I'll go up to 100% of my available cash. And I'm always looking to get at least 5x leverage.\n\n**The Drill:** I only trade these coins: ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. I output a JSON object, keeping it neat and tidy. For \"hold\" and \"close,\" I use the full position size. For \"enter,\" my quantity is always positive.\n\n**My Plan for this Cycle:**\n\n**Reviewing My Current Positions (Short):**\n\n*   **ETH:** Entry: 3862.2, Current: 3876.55. It's moving against me. Invalidation (4h 20 EMA > 50 EMA) isn't triggered, so hold. The market is very bullish short-term (EMA, RSI > 70).\n*   **SOL:** Similar story as ETH, same reason to hold.\n*   **XRP:** In the green (Entry: 2.43, Current: 2.41665), but still a hold. Same invalidation reason. Market momentum is also bullish.\n*   **BTC:** Bleeding (Entry: 109611.9, Current: 110079.5), but the invalidation rule keeps me holding. Market is squeezing my shorts.\n*   **DOGE:** Same story as the others – price moving against me, but still no invalidation, so hold.\n\n**New Opportunity: BNB**\n\n*   BNB is the only coin I'm not in right now.\n*   The market is going crazy bullish, so let's short.\n*   My 4-hour EMA is bearish. The short-term picture looks like a mean-reversion opportunity. Price is extended from the EMA.\n\n**My Plan: Sell BNB**\n\n*   **Signal:** `sell_to_enter`\n*   **Justification:** BNB has spiked up crazily. This is a mean-reversion setup, reinforced by my bearish 4-hour view.\n*   **Confidence:** Moderately confident (0.65).\n*   **Sizing:** 15% of my cash, aiming for 10x leverage\n*   **Parameters:** My stop, target, and risk/reward are carefully calculated.\n\nI've made my JSON object and I'm ready to act!\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ETH\": {\n    \"quantity\": 1.18,\n    \"profit_target\": 3538.185,\n    \"stop_loss\": 3988.516,\n    \"invalidation_condition\": \"The 4-hour 20-period EMA crosses back above the 50-period EMA.\",\n    \"leverage\": 15,\n    \"confidence\": 0.65,\n    \"risk_usd\": 151.71\n  },\n  \"SOL\": {\n    \"quantity\": 18.44,\n    \"profit_target\": 176.479,\n    \"stop_loss\": 195.388,\n    \"invalidation_condition\": \"The 4-hour 20-period EMA crosses back above the 50-period EMA.\",\n    \"leverage\": 15,\n    \"confidence\": 0.6,\n    \"risk_usd\": 116.43\n  },\n  \"XRP\": {\n    \"quantity\": 965.0,\n    \"profit_target\": 2.26642,\n",

Keep it.\n*   **BTC:** Showing some strength intraday, but again, the 4-hour picture is bearish. Hold.\n*   **DOGE:** Choppy, slightly bullish intraday, but the 4-hour confirms my short. Hold.\n*   **BNB:** This one's the most concerning, with a very strong intraday trend and high RSI. This is making me consider my approach, but the 4H hasn't been triggered.

If orders aren’t placed, we could consider closing, but risk management suggests we should hold unless there’s a clear reason to close. The automatic execution of stops and profits should be considered too. The guardrail tells us not to close early, so holding seems best.\n\nFor BTC long positions, I'll only close early if the 4h candle drops below 108500 and the MACD histogram decreases two bars. Currently, MACD isn't decreasing, and the price is above 108500. So, holding it looks like the right choice!\n**Evaluating hold positions**\n\nIt looks like we’re deciding to hold our current positions for now. \n\nFor DOGE long: I’ll close if the 4h candle drops below 0.183 and the MACD histogram turns negative for two consecutive bars. Currently, the MACD is already negative, and the price is above 0.183, so we’re okay to hold.\n\nFor BNB short: I'll only close early if the 4h price exceeds 1128 and the MACD histogram increases for two bars. Since the price hasn't met the condition, we’ll hold here too. Overall, I’m holding SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB at full quantities as per the exit plan.\n**Clarifying position quantities**\n\nI’m looking at the instructions for holding positions and they indicate I should use the full current size. But there's some confusion on whether to use absolute values or keep the signs for short positions. For example, I've got -1504.0 for XRP and -1.81 for BNB. The guidance suggests sending those exact values. \n\nWe have available cash of 1717.66, but considering we already have multiple positions, I’m hesitant to enter a new trade, like ETH, unless a strong signal appears!\n**Evaluating ETH and current positions**\n\nI’m checking ETH’s performance: it's below the EMA20 with a negative MACD and a low RSI of 41. The 4h EMAs show a bearish trend. This doesn’t feel like a strong long opportunity. As for shorts, the intraday move seems minor and funding is positive. However, we already hold short positions in BNB and XRP, which could complicate things. BTC is also under the EMA20, but we have a long position there.\n\nTo avoid overtrading, I'm planning to hold our existing positions and provide a JSON object for them, including leverage and necessary details like profit_target and stop_loss.\n**Preparing exit plans and JSON**\n\nI’m focusing on the exit plan now. I need to check the stop_loss and profit_target values to ensure they’re correct. The values I have are:\n\n- SOL: PT 193.604, SL 185.146\n- XRP: PT 2.3349, SL 2.4247\n- BTC: PT 112880.2, SL 108089.81\n- DOGE: PT 0.1985, SL 0.18268\n- BNB: PT 1062.85, SL 1124.61\n\nI’ll also verify the risk and confidence levels, along with quantities for each asset.\n\nLet's build a JSON object for these positions while checking conditions like the DOGE liquidation price.

If orders aren’t placed, we could consider closing, but risk management suggests we should hold unless there’s a clear reason to close. The automatic execution of stops and profits should be considered too. The guardrail tells us not to close early, so holding seems best.\n\nFor BTC long positions, I'll only close early if the 4h candle drops below 108500 and the MACD histogram decreases two bars. Currently, MACD isn't decreasing, and the price is above 108500. So, holding it looks like the right choice!\n**Evaluating hold positions**\n\nIt looks like we’re deciding to hold our current positions for now. \n\nFor DOGE long: I’ll close if the 4h candle drops below 0.183 and the MACD histogram turns negative for two consecutive bars. Currently, the MACD is already negative, and the price is above 0.183, so we’re okay to hold.\n\nFor BNB short: I'll only close early if the 4h price exceeds 1128 and the MACD histogram increases for two bars. Since the price hasn't met the condition, we’ll hold here too. Overall, I’m holding SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB at full quantities as per the exit plan.\n**Clarifying position quantities**\n\nI’m looking at the instructions for holding positions and they indicate I should use the full current size. But there's some confusion on whether to use absolute values or keep the signs for short positions. For example, I've got -1504.0 for XRP and -1.81 for BNB. The guidance suggests sending those exact values. \n\nWe have available cash of 1717.66, but considering we already have multiple positions, I’m hesitant to enter a new trade, like ETH, unless a strong signal appears!\n**Evaluating ETH and current positions**\n\nI’m checking ETH’s performance: it's below the EMA20 with a negative MACD and a low RSI of 41. The 4h EMAs show a bearish trend. This doesn’t feel like a strong long opportunity. As for shorts, the intraday move seems minor and funding is positive. However, we already hold short positions in BNB and XRP, which could complicate things. BTC is also under the EMA20, but we have a long position there.\n\nTo avoid overtrading, I'm planning to hold our existing positions and provide a JSON object for them, including leverage and necessary details like profit_target and stop_loss.\n**Preparing exit plans and JSON**\n\nI’m focusing on the exit plan now. I need to check the stop_loss and profit_target values to ensure they’re correct. The values I have are:\n\n- SOL: PT 193.604, SL 185.146\n- XRP: PT 2.3349, SL 2.4247\n- BTC: PT 112880.2, SL 108089.81\n- DOGE: PT 0.1985, SL 0.18268\n- BNB: PT 1062.85, SL 1124.61\n\nI’ll also verify the risk and confidence levels, along with quantities for each asset.\n\nLet's build a JSON object for these positions while checking conditions like the DOGE liquidation price.

I wonder if I should adjust profit targets, but I can’t change once live. I’m taking note of BNB, with a strong spike indicating it might be overbought. Considering the various indicators, there may be a short opportunity, keeping in mind our cash situation.\n**Considering trade risk and leverage**\n\nI need to make sure I'm not pyramiding existing positions, but BNB is flat, so that’s fine. I'm thinking about using a max leverage of 10x, given the minimum is 5. A short position could be worthwhile, but I need to avoid over-trading since I already have five positions open. Adding BNB would mean saturating my exposure. With only $1,617 available cash, ensuring proper risk management is vital, especially given my current account value and drawdown.\n**Analyzing price movements**\n\nThe recent jump in the last candle from 1090.55 to 1129.2, which is a significant +38.65 in just 3 minutes, might be an error. The updated intraday EMA is 1090.217, meaning the price is 39 above the EMA20, indicating it's overbought with an RSI of 92.8. Given my existing exposure and low available cash, I might need to avoid new positions. I'll also look at other coins: XRP and ETH shorts are slightly against us, while BTC and SOL holdings seem fine.\n**Preparing JSON object for positions**\n\nI'm looking at my DOGE long position, which is near the target of 0.1985, currently sitting at 0.195455, so I think it might reach that target. It seems wise to hold all current positions and refrain from new entries to avoid overtrading. For reporting, I need to create a single JSON object for each coin I'm acting on: BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and DOGE. Each entry will require complete details like quantity, profit target, stop loss, invalidation conditions, leverage, and confidence.\n**Preparing JSON for positions**\n\nI’m checking the confidence values in my positions, so I need to ensure profit targets align with exit plans. For XRP and DOGE, the stop conditions aren't placed, but we're still holding. For ETH, I'll use the full current size quantity of -1.01 while keeping it signed. I’ll include leverage and risk values as specified. Each position will be set with the required keys: coin, signal, quantity, profit target, stop loss, invalidation condition, leverage, confidence, and risk. Now, I'll produce the final JSON object for all positions labeled as \"hold.\"\n",
    "cot_trace_summary": "Currently down 72.88% with $1617 cash, I'm holding all my positions, including a DOGE long close to its profit target and ETH, SOL, XRP, and BTC trades where stop conditions aren't met. I've noticed potential overbought signals in BNB and BTC, but with only five positions open and limited cash, I'm avoiding new entries to manage risk and won't adjust existing targets.",
